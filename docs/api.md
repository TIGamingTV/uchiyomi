# Uchiyomi API

Everything the web app does, it does over this API, so anything you can do in the browser you can script.

This page covers how to authenticate and the endpoints worth scripting. It is not an exhaustive dump of
every route; the full list is at the bottom for reference, and the complete, browsable reference is served
by the app itself at **`/api/docs`** (Swagger UI, with "try it out") from
[`bff/openapi.yaml`](../bff/openapi.yaml). Both this list and that file are checked against the registered
routes in both directions by `bff/test/openapiCoverage.test.ts`, so neither can silently fall behind.

## Authenticating

There are two ways in, and for scripts you want the second one.

**Session tokens** are what the web app uses: `POST /auth/login` returns a JWT that expires after 15 minutes,
refreshed with a rotating cookie. Fine for a browser, miserable for a cron job.

**API tokens** are long-lived, revocable, and scoped. Create one under **Profile → Connections → API tokens → New token** (the form opens inline).
The token is shown once, so copy it then. It looks like `uy_` followed by random characters.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer uy_your_token_here" https://your-server/api/home
```

### Scopes

| Scope | What it allows |
| --- | --- |
| `read` | `GET` requests, plus `POST /api/series/search` — a query whose input happens to be a body. Every token has this. |
| `write` | Anything that changes data: progress, favorites, adding series. |
| `admin` | The `/api/admin/*` endpoints. |

Scopes only ever *restrict*. An `admin`-scoped token belonging to a non-admin account still cannot reach the
admin API, and a token without `write` gets `403` on any non-`GET` request other than the library search:

```json
{ "error": "forbidden", "message": "This token is read-only." }
```

Give a token the least it needs. A backup script that only reads your library should be `read`, so that a
token accidentally committed to a repo cannot delete anything.

Tokens can be given an expiry, and revoking one takes effect on the next request. Both are managed in the
same panel as your active sessions.

### Images and OPDS

`/img/*` is authorised by the `yomi_img` cookie rather than a header, because `<img>` tags can't send one — it
also accepts an OPDS token over HTTP Basic, so an OPDS reader can load covers and pages with the same
credentials it uses for the feed, **and, since v0.29.0, an API token as a Bearer**, so a third-party client
such as the Mihon extension needs one credential for the JSON and the pictures alike. A `read`-scoped token
is enough for images. `/opds/*` uses HTTP Basic with your OPDS token as the password
(**Profile → Connections → External readers**) and does not accept API tokens. A disabled account's OPDS token is refused (**401**) on the feed
and on `/img/*` alike, like every other credential of a disabled account, and works again once the account
is re-enabled — the token itself is not revoked.

### The Komga-compatible surface

`/api/v1/*` and `/api/v2/*` (since v0.38.0) speak Komga's API for Mihon's Komga extension and its Komga
tracker, and take an API token three ways: `X-API-Key: uy_…` on every request (the extension's API key
field), `Authorization: Bearer uy_…` (the way the rest of the API takes it), or `Authorization: Basic` with
the token as the **password** and any username (what the extension sends after a 401 when no key is set) —
in that order of precedence, and any presented credential outranks a remembered cookie. No credential is
**401** with `WWW-Authenticate: Basic` — the extension's Basic authenticator fires on a 401 and on nothing
else. Account passwords are refused there on purpose, right or wrong: the protocol has no channel for a
two-factor code, and a password path would have walked around 2FA and the lockout. OPDS tokens and session
JWTs are refused too. Ten failed credentials from one address in five minutes (the budget `/auth/login`
has) and every further request from that address that presents a credential is **429** `too_many_requests`
with `Retry-After` until the window ends; a request with no credential and a cookie-only request are
neither counted nor blocked, and a valid key never counts. A credentialed request also sets an
`UCHIYOMI-SESSION` cookie, honoured **only by those routes**, for the tracker's requests, which carry no
credential at all; the cookie names the token row, which is re-read on every use, so revoking the token,
letting it expire or disabling the account ends the cookie on the next request, and signing out of the
web app (`POST /auth/logout`) clears it from a browser alongside the other cookies. Details under
[Komga-compatible API](#komga-compatible-api-mihons-komga-extension-and-tracker) in the route list.

## Conventions

- Base URL is your server's origin. All paths below are absolute.
- Request and response bodies are JSON; send `Content-Type: application/json` when posting.
- List endpoints return `{ "content": [...] }`.
- Errors return a non-2xx status with `{ "error": "<code>", "message": "<human sentence>" }`.
- IDs are strings. Series and book IDs are stable; don't parse them.

## Common tasks

**What am I in the middle of?**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" https://your-server/api/home
```

Returns the shelves the home screen is built from, including the on-deck books with their progress.

**Mark a chapter as read**

```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"page": 20, "completed": true, "silent": true}' \
  https://your-server/api/books/BOOK_ID/progress
```

`silent: true` means "this is an explicit action, not organic reading": it writes exactly what you say
(including marking something *unread*) and stays out of your reading history and streaks. Leave it off and
the write can only ever move a chapter forward to completed, never back.

If you have a tracker connected, finishing a chapter this way syncs it like any other.

**Add a series**

Two steps: find it, then add the result. Adding takes a source and that source's own id for the series, not a
URL.

```bash
# 1. find it — searches your enabled sources in order and returns {source, sourceId, title, ...}
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" "https://your-server/api/sources/find?q=solo+leveling"

# 2. add it
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"source":"mangadex","sourceId":"32d76d19-8a05-4db0-9fc2-e0b0648fe9d0","chapterCount":10,"autoUpdate":true}' \
  https://your-server/api/sources/add
```

An add **never fetches a chapter the library already holds**. What is held is read from the library by
folder across every root, so a read-only library the server did not download counts, whatever the files
there are named — removing a series and adding it again downloads only what is genuinely missing, instead
of fetching the whole back catalogue and filing every chapter a second time. One deliberate exception: a
chapter removed with **Delete files** *is* fetched again. The nightly sweep treats that tombstone as held
so it does not undo a deliberate deletion; an add is somebody asking for the chapter now.

`chapterCount` limits how many chapters to grab (omit for all). It counts from the OLDEST unless
`chapterFrom: "newest"` is sent, and whichever end it counts from the selection is downloaded ascending, so
a partial add always reads as a coherent run. With `newest`, the chapters below the selection are left to
**Find missing chapters** rather than the updater: a chapter floor is set on the series so the scheduled
sweep fetches new releases only, instead of backfilling the whole back catalogue five per night with each
new chapter queued behind it. `autoUpdate` enrols it in the scheduled updater.

`chapterFrom: "none"` (since v0.34.0) adds the series with **no chapters at all** — the dialog's "Nothing
yet — pick chapters later". The row is created and followed, the listing is written so the series page can
show what the source has, nothing is downloaded, and the chapter floor is set just above the newest listed
number (`max + 0.001`: every number the source lists today is below it, the next release is not; no floor
when the source lists nothing), so auto-update takes only chapters released after the add. Older ones can
be fetched from the series page. The row is stamped as checked — the add just asked the source — so the
series' `checkedAt` and the source's chapter count are set from the start rather than after the first
sweep, and a series removed from the library and added back this way is revived under its old id (its
favourites, notes and read marks with it). `chapterCount` is ignored, and an empty listing is not
`no_chapters` — an announced title with nothing out yet is what this is for. The answer is `{ok, title,
folder, chapters: 0, started: false, nothing: true}`; `nothing` is what tells it from "already in library",
which also answers `chapters: 0`.

`GET /api/sources` lists what you can reach: each entry carries `id`, `name`, `lang` (null when the source
declares no single language, which means it belongs to every language group), `latest` (whether it can be
browsed without a query), `popular` (whether it can offer its own popularity ranking), `used` (how many
series in the library came from it), its health `status`, and `note`.

**MangaDex in other languages** (since v0.52.0, #123). `mangadex` is MangaDex in English, always on. Every other
language an admin switches on (`mangadexLangs` on `PATCH /api/admin/settings`) is a source of its own, with the id
`mangadex-<code>` and the name "MangaDex (ES-419)" (`mangadex-es-419`, `mangadex-pt-br`, `mangadex-zh-hant`, …) and
`lang` set to the app code. Its search and Popular find only titles with chapters in that language, its Newest is
its newest chapters, and its chapter list is that language only, with no fallback; English search is unfiltered and
English's chapter list still falls back to other languages for a title with no English. Newest, in every language
including English, is the newest chapters in that language (`/chapter` ordered by `readableAt`) and the series they
belong to, so a title whose last English chapter is old no longer heads English Newest because of an upload in
another language. Every MangaDex source shares one rate limit: a 429 pauses all of them until the moment MangaDex
names, and a request that would wait more than ten seconds is refused without being sent (a listing counts it as
slow, never as a cooldown). Each carries `extension: {pkgName: "mangadex", name: "MangaDex"}`, so a client can
show them as one provider. A chapter's `lang` on a MangaDex copy is the app code (`es-419`, never MangaDex's
`es-la`).

`status` is `ok`, `disabled`, or, while a cooldown is running, one of `rate_limited` / `blocked` / `down`.
It is also `quiet`, which means the source answers without error and returns nothing: a listing that has
stopped parsing never throws, so it never earns a cooldown, and before this existed such a source kept
reporting `ok` and kept being fetched first.

`note` is one sentence saying what is wrong, or `null` when nothing is. It is written for readers, so it
never contains a hostname, a component name or any part of the recorded error. The operator-facing half of
the diagnosis, which does name containers and config files, is only on the admin routes. Since v0.49.1
`noteCode` is the diagnosis code the sentence belongs to (every code has one sentence), so a client can say it in
its reader's language.

`POST /api/admin/sources/:id/test` (admin) probes a source right now: for a source that has a homepage of
its own it fetches that homepage directly, without the Cloudflare solver, and then exercises the adapter
(search, series, chapters, pages), returning per-step `checks`, the `probe` result and a `diagnosis`.
Extension sources have no homepage to ask (the engine talks to the site, not this server), so for them the
homepage step is skipped and `probe` carries no `httpStatus`: only the adapter's own result. It ignores any cooldown, which is the
point. Since v0.49.0 it records what it found as evidence (`source_health.live_*` and the per-stage
`stages`), which the Health page's *Source health* check reads, and it still never changes the cooldown or
`checked_at`: a diagnostic that changed the diagnosis would let repeated clicks drive a source's cooldown to
its ceiling. The answer adds `{state, stage, ms, recorded}`: `state` is `pass`, `fail`, or `inconclusive`
when the test's own deadline (`SOURCE_TEST_TIMEOUT_MS`, which now bounds every call inside it) ended it before
anything failed, and `stage` is where (`search`, `chapters`, `pages`). `diagnosis.code` is never `ok` when
`ok` is false; it can be `extension_error` (the extension engine answered with the extension's own error)
or `unnumbered` (chapters listed without usable numbers), and `upstream_down` now means only that the engine
itself did not answer or refused Uchiyomi's login. A pass reports `canClear` rather than clearing the
block itself, because the smoke test stops at listing page URLs and never fetches an image byte. The
`probe` is always present: `{httpStatus?, finalUrl?, transport?, looksHtml?, adapterOk, needsSolver}`,
where `httpStatus` is absent when no homepage request was made and `0` when one was made and no HTTP answer
came back — and a live `adapterOk: true` outranks whatever the stored error says, so an extension source
that passes its checks no longer carries a Cloudflare verdict from an earlier afternoon (PR #56). The same
rule reaches the Health page's *Source health* check: a stored error older than the source's last success is
history, not a fix to go and apply, and such a row shows only its live finding. A stored `Cloudflare bypass
currently disabled` diagnoses as `cf_challenge` (public `reason` *This source is protected by a check we
could not get past.*) with an admin `fix` that names the engine's own switch rather than Uchiyomi's solver,
by the names the shipped compose files use, never the development stack's: *The extension engine's own
Cloudflare bypass is switched off. On the Suwayomi engine's container (uchiyomi-suwayomi in the shipped
compose files) set FLARESOLVERR_ENABLED=true and FLARESOLVERR_URL to the same solver address Uchiyomi uses
(http://uchiyomi-flaresolverr:8191 in the shipped files), then recreate it. The v0.37.0 compose files
already set both, so an upgrade that recreates the engine is the fix there.* Since v0.37.0 this route and
the scheduled source check also read the source's slow streak, so `diagnosis.code` can be `too_slow`
(*This source answers, but takes longer than the time it is given.*; before v0.49.1 *…but more slowly than it is
given.*) from both, not only from Discover's health view;
its `fix` names the configured `SOURCE_LATEST_TIMEOUT_MS` budget in seconds (*longer than 8s*).
Since v0.49.1 `diagnosis.code` can be `site_offline` (*The site says it is offline (its own page)*; fix *Wait for
the site to come back, or find other sources for its series.*): a site engine (Madara, Manganato) that finds
nothing on a page checks whether the page is the site's own offline or maintenance notice -- small (under 8 KB),
its title or first heading saying so, with none of the engine's own markup -- and fails with that kind instead of
answering an empty list. The sweep then treats the source as one that did not answer (the listing stands, no
empty streak), and the per-stage evidence records the failure with `kind: site_offline`. The cooldowns are not
changed by it: Discover and global search report the failure as they report any other, so an offline site that
someone keeps browsing or searching goes into the normal escalating cooldown (5 minutes, growing to 30). The sweep
skips a source in a cooldown, so the first sweep check after the site comes back can wait up to 30 minutes.

`POST /api/admin/sources/check` (admin) runs the source watchdog immediately instead of waiting for its
daily sweep. It probes every enabled source and smoke-tests its adapter, one at a time because they share a
single Cloudflare solver. Since v0.49.0 it runs in the background: it answers **202** with the progress at
once, and `GET /api/admin/sources/check` reads `{running, by, startedAt, finishedAt, total, done, current,
result, error}` until `running` is false; `result` then holds the verdict per source (each with `state`,
`stage` and `kind`), `needsAttention` (every confirmed live failure except a rate limit, plus moved sites),
`inconclusive` and `notified` (the ids pushed: a push goes out once per new or changed failure, not daily,
and links to Health). It applies only the two fixes that are
verifiable: it follows a site to a new address **after** the new one passes a smoke test (rolling back if it
does not). Everything else is reported with a reason and a suggested fix, and admins get a push notification
for what is new. Answers **409** while a sweep is running (since v0.49.0 with its `progress`, so a client can
follow that one instead). It no longer touches extensions -- that is its own scheduled task,
below, because the engine has to re-read its repositories before "an update is available" means anything.

`PATCH /api/admin/sources/custom/:id` (admin) changes a custom site's `base` address and nothing else. The
source id is derived from its name and the library is keyed on that id, so editing in place is the only way
to follow a site to a new domain without orphaning every series that came from it.

`POST /api/sources/add` answers as soon as the outcome is decided and downloads afterwards. It used to hold
the request until the first chapter had been fetched, measured at 15 to 59 seconds on a real install.
Everything that decides the answer still happens inline and still gets its own status code: **403** disabled,
**404** `no_chapters` (also the answer when every copy the source lists is from a group blocked
server-wide), **409** `duplicate` (with the "add anyway" message), and **200** with `chapters: 0`
for a title already in the library. A successful reply now carries `started: true`, which is what
distinguishes "downloading now" from "already had it" — previously only `chapters === 0` said so.

A successful reply also carries **`seriesId`**: the library id of the series the add landed on — the row it
found already there, the one it minted, the one it revived, or the one it stamped with nothing left to
fetch — so a client can open the series instead of searching for it by title and hoping. One branch cannot
answer with it: a fresh download is answered before the first chapter has been scanned, and until that scan
runs there is no row to name. That id arrives on the job card instead (`GET /api/sources/jobs`, `seriesId`),
which the add dialog is already polling. The id is withheld from a caller who may not see the series, which
an "already in library" answer can name — every by-id route checks the same thing. The **409** `duplicate`
body follows the same rule: `existing` is `{title, source, id?}`, where the lookup behind it deliberately
spans every library on the server (a duplicate is a property of the server, not of the viewer) and the `id`
is added only when the caller may open that series. When every chapter selected is already here, the reply
carries **`alreadyHere`** with `chapters: 0` and `started: false` — and the series still gets its routing,
its floor, its listing and its cover, exactly as a downloading add would.

The body may also name `alsoFollow: [{source, sourceId}]` (at most six): other sources the add dialog
already found carrying the title, to be followed for the new series when they qualify. **Admins only**: a
member's `alsoFollow` is dropped before the add, which then proceeds exactly as with none given (no
judgement, no card) — following is an admin act, as `POST /api/admin/series/:id/sources` is. No search runs
for them. Each is judged on the server once the listing exists — at once for a `chapterFrom: "none"` add,
after the first chapter lands on a download — by two rules that stand in for the plan's human
confirmation. The candidate's own title must match this series' (exact or containing, after normalisation,
alt titles included), else `title_differs`. Then its numbering: the primary must list at least three
numbers (`too_few_listed` otherwise); with an **exact** title and a primary listing at least ten, the
candidate must list at least 90% of the primary's numbers (the fill-scan rule — a copy that runs on past
the primary still qualifies); with a containing title, or a primary listing fewer than ten, the numbering
must agree **both ways** — at least 90% of the primary's numbers listed by the candidate and at least 90%
of the candidate's listed by the primary — else `numbering_differs`, so a sequel that continues past the
primary ("Tokyo Ghoul:re" 1..60 for "Tokyo Ghoul" 1..20) is refused although it lists every number, while
"(Official)" 1..22 for 1..20 (20 of 22 = 0.91) follows. The `coverage` reported for a two-way judgement is
the lower of the two shares. At most two sources are followed per series, in the order given; a follower
this path wrote has no author and reads `auto: true` on the series' sources. The results are not in the
add's answer: they land on the series' job card (below), which a `none` add gets minted for the purpose.

One response is deliberately gone: the **429** `blocked` for a source refusing downloads. That can only be
known after the download is attempted, so it now arrives as a failed job carrying its reason. This is also
strictly better than before, where the 429 came back only after the whole chapter attempt had burned its
budget.

`GET /api/sources/jobs` lists downloads in progress, and a card carries `seriesId` once its first chapter
has been scanned in — the add that started it was answered before that row existed. Since v0.49.0 a card that
names no series itself (a Fetch, a fill, a refetch) carries the id of the series row holding its folder. A
finished job is swept a day after it ends (five minutes before v0.47.0); a
**failed** one is never swept, because it is the only record that the download did not work, and it carries
a `reason` naming the source and how far it got (since v0.49.1 with its codes, `reasonSaid`; a run card's and an
activity entry's `reason` too), and since v0.49.0 `left`: the chapters it did not land,
ascending and at most 300, which is what a Try again sends back as `numbers` to `POST /api/sources/fetch` --
only on a failed Fetch or add (`origin` `fetch` or `add`), since a fill's and a refetch's chapters are not ones
that route can take again. Every card carries `origin` (`add`, `fetch`, `fill` or `refetch`). An
add's card also carries `cover: {source, url}`, its source's cover, so the Downloads view can draw it before
the series has a thumbnail of its own. Its starter keeps a card wherever the series lands, without `seriesId`
and `cover` when it lands in a library they cannot browse or above their age cap. `DELETE
/api/sources/jobs/<folder>` dismisses a job that has stopped: since v0.49.0 only its starter or an admin
(**403** for anyone else, answered first; **404**, as for no job at all, for a card the caller is not shown --
Cancel answers the same way), and **409** `running`
for one still downloading — or one whose auto-follow judgement is still running (`autoFollow.done ===
false`), since the follows would still land while the report they belong to was gone. Since v0.50.0 the same route
dismisses a folder's chapters that could not be saved when it has no job card (the scheduled check's, a Check
now's: a Needs attention card of failed chapters alone), on the same terms — **404** when the caller is not shown
any, **403** unless each is theirs or the caller is an admin — and dismissing a job card clears its folder's failed
chapters with it; either way they leave the day's activity feed and the download log. A card whose add named
`alsoFollow` candidates carries `autoFollow: {done, results}` —
`done: false` with no results while the other sources are asked, then one entry per candidate in the order
given, `{source, name, theirTitle, followed, coverage, why}`, with `why` one of `followed`,
`numbering_differs` (under 90% of the primary's numbers listed there or, when judged both ways, under 90%
of its numbers listed here — the rule above), `language_differs` (since v0.52.0, #123: it is in another language than
the series, and nothing was asked), `title_differs`, `unreachable` (threw or timed out — never
mistaken for "lists nothing"), `too_few_listed` (the primary lists under three numbers; nothing was
asked), `not_tried` (the 90-second wall ran out first, or the judgement itself failed before any source
was asked — every candidate then reads so, rather than the card finishing with an empty list), `cap`
(already following two) or `unavailable` (the primary itself, disabled, in a cooldown, not loaded, or
outside the caller's age cap). A `none` add with candidates gets a card with `total: 0, status: "done"`
just to carry this; it lives a day after the judgement ends, so a closed dialog loses nothing.

**Who sees which card** (since v0.49.0). Every viewer gets the cards of the series they can browse — library
access, age cap and the 18+ hide, the rule the series themselves follow — where before cards were filtered only
while the 18+ hide was on, so a member walled off from a library still received its cards' titles. A card whose
folder is not a series yet (an add whose first chapter has not been scanned in) goes to whoever started it and
to admins; a **failed** card goes only to whoever started it and to admins, on top of the first rule. A run's
`current` series is left out by the same rule, for every viewer.

**Reading a chapter before adding it** (since v0.47.0, #91). `GET /api/sources/preview?source=&sourceId=` lists
that series' chapters on the source — the add dialog's own cached listing, one copy per number — as
`{title, content: [{number, title, scanlator}]}`; `GET /api/sources/preview/pages?…&number=` answers `{count}`;
and `GET /img/sources/preview?…&number=&i=` is one page, by index. A chapter is named by its **number** in a
listing the server fetched itself, and a page by its index: no URL and no chapter id from the caller ever
reaches a source, because a site engine's page list is a fetch through the Cloudflare solver's browser, inside
the network. Pages go through the same guard as covers (an extension's only from the engine's own origin),
one at a time per source, and are served as the original bytes, `no-store`, only when they are an image.
Nothing is written. An account with an age limit gets **403** `age_limited`; a disabled source **403**, one in
a cooldown **429**; the messages are generic.

**Cancelling, and the server's own runs** (since v0.47.0, #82). Every card carries `startedAt` and `mine` —
whether this account started it. `POST /api/sources/jobs/<folder>/cancel` stops a running job after the
chapter in flight (its starter or an admin; **403** for anyone else, **409** `not_running` once it has
stopped): what landed stays, a re-fetch puts back every old copy it had set aside and did not reach, and the
card ends `done` with `cancelled: true` and a `reason` saying how far it got; `cancelRequested` is set
meanwhile. The response also carries `runs`: one card per run the server does by itself — `sweep` (checking
every series for new chapters), `repair` (the library repair, `done`/`total` counting its steps, `step`
naming the current one) and `newest` (a bulk "Fetch newest") — each `{kind, startedAt, finishedAt?, status:
running|done|cancelled|error, done, total, fetched, failed, current?: {id, title}, step?, cancelRequested?,
reason?, mine}`. An admin sees every run; the account that started a bulk run sees that one; nobody else
sees any, because `current` names a series that may be in a library they cannot open (and is left out when
the request hides that series anyway). `POST /api/sources/runs/<kind>/cancel` stops one the same way as a
shutdown does — between series and between chapters, never mid-write — and `DELETE /api/sources/runs/<kind>`
dismisses a finished one. Both cancels are audited as `download.cancel`. Since v0.49.0 a repair's card also
carries `repairKind` — `full` for a run of every step (the nightly, Tasks → Run now, Health's *Fix all issues*),
else `fix_short`, `fill`, `retry` or `steps:<a+b…>[:now]` — `label` (the series title or source name a one-row
Health fix is about), `number` (the chapter's, for a one-chapter fix) and `seriesId` (the series `label` names);
`label`, `number` and `seriesId` are left out for a viewer who may not list that series, and whenever `current`
is. A run that cannot download a chapter (a solver reset, a page count, names, directions, or a reset of failed
chapters that names no source and is not `now`) carries `downloads: false`.

**Every chapter coming in** (since v0.48.1). The response also carries `activity: {active, recent}`: each chapter
the server is downloading (`active`, oldest first) or finished in the last day (`recent`, newest first), whatever
started it — `{id, seriesId, folder, title, number, source, origin, status, startedAt, finishedAt?, pages?,
reason?, mine}`, where `origin` is `add`, `fetch`, `fill` (Find missing chapters), `check` (Check for new chapters,
which is also how a newly followed source's chapters arrive), `sweep` (the scheduled check), `repair`, `bulk`
(Fetch newest), `refetch`, `server` or, since v0.49.0, `archive` (the slow archive, below), and `status` is
`queued` (waiting its turn at the source), `downloading`, `done`, `partial` or `failed`. A file already on disk is
not listed. Each viewer gets the series they can browse; a folder that is not a series yet (an add's first chapter)
goes to whoever started it and to admins. Since v0.49.0 `recent` survives a restart: every finished chapter is also
written down (kept a week), and the last day of it, at most 500 entries, is read back when the server starts, with
fresh `id`s. Since v0.49.1 a `partial` chapter that is whole now (the completion pass filled its pages, or a later
download wrote it whole) reads `done`, there and in what is written down; and the slow archive's first chapter of a
series the library holds nothing of, scanned into the library at once, is listed once the library holds it.

**The slow archive** (since v0.49.0, #117). `POST /api/sources/archive {seriesIds}` (1-500) queues series to be
fetched a chapter at a time, paced per source — by default four chapters an hour per source, a random 1.5-4 s
between pages, one page at a time, a jittered break after each chapter (never under 45 s) and now and then a long
one — so a whole back catalogue comes in over nights or days without the site ever seeing a burst. Admins and
members with `canDownload` may, for series they can see, when every source the series follows is inside their age
limit; each id answers `{id, title?, outcome}` with `queued`, `already`, `nothing` (nothing left to fetch below its
boundary), `unrouted` (no source of it is loaded), `denied` (a source outside the age limit) or `not_found` (no
title — also for a series the caller cannot see). Audited as `download.archive`. The archive owns the listed
numbers below a boundary — the series' floor, else a hair above the newest listed number; a series with no listing
yet gets one at its first turn, and one whose numbering waits for a review (#116) gets it at its first turn after
the renumbering settles, in the numbers the series keeps (meanwhile `waiting.why: 'renumbering'`) — and the sweep
keeps the new releases above it (it reads the higher of the floor and the boundary while an archive is queued or
paused); `chapter_floor` is never changed while it runs, and its
finish clears a Latest-N floor only if it is still the one it started from. It never searches other sites or
follows new ones. It waits for every sweep, repair and source check, for the admin's pause and hours, for the disk
floor, for anybody else's download on the same source or series, and for a source's cooldown; a refusal (403, 429)
leaves that source alone 1 h, 3 h, 12 h, then a day, and the series stays queued, and a listing that cannot be read
is asked for again on the same ladder, per series (`waiting.why: 'listing'`, with `until`). Its chapters carry
`origin: archive`, never count as Updates (the series' seen count rises with them) and send no notification.
`POST /api/sources/archive/<seriesId>/pause` and `.../resume`, and `DELETE /api/sources/archive/<seriesId>` (stop,
or dismiss a finished one; audited as `download.archive_stop`) are for whoever queued it or an admin (**403**
otherwise, **404** to one who cannot see the series, **409** `done` for pause and resume on a finished one); a
chapter in flight finishes either way. The queue is `archive` on `GET /api/sources/jobs` (and alone on `GET
/api/sources/archive`): `{paused, perHour, window, waiting?, series: [...]}`, each row `{seriesId, title, state,
direction, done, left, failed, bytes, mine, current?, nextAt?, etaMs?, waiting?, attention?, queuedAt, startedAt,
finishedAt?, note?}`, limited to the series the viewer can browse; `waiting.why` and `attention.why` take the
values openapi.yaml's `ArchiveSeries` lists, and `left` never counts a chapter that has landed and waits for the
library scan. The rows are read at most every ten seconds, unfiltered, and filtered on every call, so one viewer's
answer is never another's. A finished row is listed for a day, or until dismissed when it left chapters behind
(`attention.why: 'finished_with_gaps'`, with `note {capped, held, blocked}`). `POST /api/sources/add` takes
`archive: true` ("Archive the rest slowly") and answers `archive` with the outcome: `later` on a download, which
queues the rest once the first chapter is in and the listing is written, and starts on it when the add's own
chapters are in; `later` too when the add left the series' numbering for an admin's review (a folder that already
held chapters, below): it is queued, and where it starts is placed
once the renumbering has settled, in the numbers the series keeps; `nothing` when the selection was the whole
listing.
`GET /api/series/:id/listing` gains `archive` (the series' row, or null) and ghosts with `why: "archive"`, and
`POST /api/sources/fetch` answers **409** `busy` while an archive chapter of the series is in flight. Since v0.49.1
the listing's `archive` carries `pausedForAll`, the admin's pause of every archive (`paused` on the queue), which a
queued row's `state` does not show: a viewer who may not download cannot read the queue. The pacing is
the admin's, on `PATCH /api/admin/settings`: `archivePaused`, `archivePerHour` (1-30),
`archiveWindowFrom`/`archiveWindowTo` (0-23, the server's local hours, together or not at all) and
`archiveMinFreeGb` (1-2000); `GET /api/admin/settings` reads them back as `archive_paused`, `archive_per_hour`,
`archive_window_from`, `archive_window_to` and `archive_min_free_gb`, plus `archive_free_gb`, the GiB free under
the download root now. `POST /api/admin/update` now runs as the scheduled sweep does, so it answers **409** `busy`
while a sweep or a repair runs, and **500** when the sweep itself fails.

`GET /api/sources/popular?source=<id>&page=<n>` is the same listing sorted by the source's OWN popularity,
not by anything this server computes: it is the page each site already publishes, reached with a different
sort. Every guard on the newest listing applies identically. A source that cannot offer one reports
`popular: false` and is simply not asked. Note the two listings are cached separately, so asking for one
never serves the other, and an empty *popular* page is deliberately not treated as evidence that a source's
parser has drifted, the way an empty *newest* page is.

`GET /img/sources/icon/<id>` returns a source's own icon at 64px, resolved from the extension's declared
icon or, for a site added by URL, from the site's own favicon. A source with no findable icon gets a
lettered tile rendered here rather than a 404, so clients never need a fallback and a missing icon does not
log a console error in every visitor's browser. Either answer is cached, so a source without an icon costs
one lookup rather than one per page load.

`GET /api/sources/latest?source=<id>&page=<n>` is bounded at `SOURCE_LATEST_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 8000) per
source and cached server-side for ten minutes per source and page, with concurrent requests for the same page
collapsed into one outbound fetch. A source that times out is recorded against its health and earns a
cooldown, so it stops being picked first.

Responses worth handling: **200** with `message: "already in library"` if you have that exact series already,
and **409** `duplicate` if a series with the same title came from a *different* source — retry with
`"force": true` to add the second copy anyway.

**403 on the whole `/api/sources/*` surface.** Two account settings gate these routes, and both are enforced
server-side rather than only in the app:

* A non-admin whose `canDownload` permission is off is refused on **every** route in this group, not just
  `add` — listing sources, searching, browsing newest, series detail and the job list all return `403`.
* An account whose `max_age_rating` is set below 18 cannot reach a source its extension declares adult. Such
  a source is omitted from `GET /api/sources` entirely, refused with `403` by id on `latest`, `search`,
  `detail` and `add`, and silently dropped from the `find` and `search-all` fan-outs (a fan-out has no single
  source to refuse). Sources with no adult signal at all — built-ins, packs, custom sites — count as not
  adult, the same way an unrated series stays visible.

Because these responses differ per account, do not cache them in anything shared. The app's service worker
explicitly excludes `/api/sources*` for that reason.

To add a whole *site* rather than one series, that is `POST /api/admin/sources/custom` (admin scope).

**Search everything at once**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" "https://your-server/api/sources/search-all?q=solo+leveling"
```

Since v0.40.0 this answers before the slow sources do. `GET /api/sources/search-all?q=<term>&wait=<ms>` returns
when every source you may reach has answered, when `wait` milliseconds have passed (clamped to
`SEARCH_FIRST_ANSWER_MS`, default 6000; omitted means that maximum), or `SEARCH_GRACE_MS` (default 1500) after
the first source that had results — whichever comes first. `content` keeps its shape (title-grouped cards, or
one rail per source with `groupBy=source`; a card for a title already in the library carries `inLibrary: true` and,
since v0.50.0, `librarySeriesId`, the series it opens — as do the results of `search`, `latest` and `popular`);
beside it, `sources` lists each source you may reach with a `state`
(`ok`, `empty`, `timeout`, `failed`, `pending`, or `skipped` with `why: disabled | cooldown` for one that was
not asked at all), `pending` counts the ones still being asked and `asked` the ones asked at all. While
`pending` is above 0, repeat the same request with a short `wait` (`wait=0` reads what is there without
waiting): the sources keep answering into a server-side entry keyed by the normalised term and kept for
`SEARCH_TTL_MS` (default 300000, at most `SEARCH_CACHE_MAX` = 50 entries), which is why the same search typed
again — by anyone — answers at once. The entry is shared, but every answer is filtered to the caller's own
reachable sources: an age-capped account neither starts nor sees an adult source that another account's search
asked. Each source is bounded at `SEARCH_SOURCE_MS` (default 20000; the solver budget for a source behind
Cloudflare) and asked through a pool of `SEARCH_CONCURRENCY` (default: `SCAN_CONCURRENCY`, itself the solver's
slot count) at a time, one lane for solver-fronted sources and one for the rest; a source that outruns its
budget is recorded as slow (never as a failure), one that throws is recorded against its health, and one that
is disabled or in a cooldown is skipped rather than asked — exactly as the newest listing treats them.

`&source=<id>` asks only that one source, which is what Discover sends while it is filtered to a source. It
narrows the set described above and never widens it: an adult source without `adult=1`, one above your age
limit, or an id that does not exist asks nobody and answers the empty shape. The entry is still keyed by the
term alone, so a narrowed search reads whatever a full one already heard, and the other way round.

`GET /api/sources/detail` is cached for ten minutes per source and series (it was ninety seconds), and
concurrent requests for the same pair — the add dialog's pre-warm and the pick that follows it — collapse
into one outbound fetch. A failed lookup is never cached, so an immediate retry asks the source again.

**Check the library for problems** (admin scope)

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" https://your-server/api/admin/health
```

Returns the same checks as the admin Health tab: chapter gaps, truncated downloads, duplicate series,
impossible chapter numbers, failing sources, the last library scan (`library-scan`: folders it could not index,
and since v0.48.2 folders it could not look into at all), and since v0.48.2 `downloads-missing`: every chapter
file in the downloads folder that is not in the library, per folder, with the reason when the scan knows it, and
since v0.50.0 `saved-twice`: series where two sources' splits of one chapter are both on disk, each item with
`bookIds` and `numbers` for the files that arrived later and the `delete` action (nothing is deleted by the check
itself), and since v0.52.0 `folders-twice`, only while the downloads folder sits inside the library or the library
inside it (by path, or met by the last scan's walk however it was mounted): `warn`, one item naming where, and the
fix in its note -- every chapter in the inner folder is otherwise scanned twice. Each check reports `status` (`ok`,
`warn`, `problem`), a
one-line `summary`, and the individual `items`. A check is `ok` exactly when none of its items is a finding:
an item flagged `info` is listed for reference (a source you turned off, a source no series uses, a chapter
already confirmed short, a gap the nightly repair has already searched for) and never decides the verdict.
Useful as a nightly cron that emails you only when `status` isn't `ok`.

`POST /api/admin/health/ignore` (since v0.48.3) takes `{check, key, ignored}` and ignores one finding, or stops
ignoring it: the finding is then reported greyed (`ignored`, `info`), stays quiet while what it is about (a gap's
missing runs, a folder's files) is part of what was ignored, and its ignore is forgotten once it has been gone
for a week. Short chapters use confirm-short, which already records the same judgement.

`GET /api/admin/health/summary` (since v0.48.0) is the cheap question the app's header asks: the last report
boiled down to `{at, worst, count, headline, key, checks}`, answered from what the Health tab or the server's
own six-hourly run stored, never by running the checks. `key` changes only when *which* checks found something
changes, so an alert dismissed for one problem comes back for a new one. Since v0.49.1 each of `checks` (worst
first) carries `summarySaid`: `headline` is `checks[0]`'s title and summary in English, and a client words it from
the check's id and those codes.

**The server's sentences as codes** (since v0.49.1). Every sentence the Health report, the downloads and the
numbering and extension-settings routes write in English also comes as codes, beside it: a `Said` is `{code,
params?, join?}` — `code` stable (`gaps.live`, `sources.failing`, `job.partial`, `renumber.onDisk`,
`pref.noChoice`, a diagnosis's `fix.moved`…), `params` what fills it (counts as numbers, moments as ISO strings,
names, file names and a system's own error text as strings), and, in a field that is a list, `join` how a part
joins the one before it (`clause` "a; b" when absent, `sentence`, `then` — a sentence that opens on a name, left as
it is — `period`, `dash`, `dashCap`, `paren`, `colon`).
The fields: a check's `summarySaid` and `noteSaid`, an item's `detailSaid` and `titleSaid`, a diagnosis's
`fixSaid` (its `reason` is its `code`'s sentence), a download card's and an activity entry's `reasonSaid` (a list),
a run card's `reasonSaid`, a refusal's `messageSaid`, and a numbering answer's `errorSaid`. The English is
unchanged and always there: a client that does not know a code shows it, and the web app does exactly that for a
whole line when any of its codes is new to it. Moments are ISO so a client says them in its reader's time zone;
the English prints them in UTC with no zone. The codes and their English are `bff/src/lib/said.ts`.

Since v0.41.0 an item also carries what can be **done** about it, so the same finding is actionable from a
script: `actions` is an ordered list of `fix_short`, `confirm_short`, `delete`, `fill`, `retry`, `test`,
`unblock`, `disable`, `merge`, `solver_reset` and, since v0.49.0, `engine_solver`, `renumber` and `keep_numbers`
(below); `bookId`, `bookIds`, `seriesId`, `seriesIds`, `sourceId` and
`keep` (the copy a duplicate pair should keep: most live chapters, then most readers, then the older row)
are the ids those actions need; `number`/`numbers` are the chapters it is about (a gap item carries at most
100 numbers, an impossible-number item at most 20 ids); and `fixed` `{at, what}` says what has already been
decided or found — `confirmed short at the source`, or what the repair's gap search concluded — which is
what greys the row. Since v0.49.0 an item may also carry `outcome` — what the last attempt found, from
stored rows: `{kind: 'gaps', at, why, followed, coverage, fetched, landed, sweep, capped, unfillable, scanned}`
(the gap `detail` is now `<n> missing — <ranges>` alone; the conclusion it used to end with lives here),
`{kind: 'short', at, why, asked?, answered?, best?, hunt?, missing?, by?}` (why a short chapter was left, or
`partial` for one saved with placeholder pages, which is offered `confirm_short` only), or `{kind:
'failures', firstAt, lastAt, attempts, resetPending}` (`firstAt` is the first failure, which a Retry now no
longer resets) — and `caveats: [{action, code, until?}]`, what an action will not be able to do, said before
it is pressed (`fill`: `updates_paused`, or `archiving`, below; `retry`: `source_cooling_down` with `until`, or
`source_off`). The gaps outcome's `why` is the repair's verdict (`followed`, `no_candidate`, `cap`, `off`,
`cooldown`, `listed`), or since v0.49.0 `posting_order` — the series is numbered by posting order, so no other
source is searched — or `archiving`, below.
`fix_short`, `fill`, `retry` and `solver_reset` are `POST /api/admin/tasks/repair/run`
with the matching `only` and target; `confirm_short` is `POST /api/admin/books/:id/confirm-short`, and on a
row that already carries `fixed` it is the withdrawal (`{confirmed: false}`); `delete` is `POST
/api/admin/series/:id/chapters/delete`, `merge` is `POST /api/admin/series/:id/merge`, and `test`/`unblock`/
`disable` are the existing `POST /api/admin/sources/:id/...` routes. Nothing on this page acts on its own:
the two destructive ones, `delete` and `merge`, are the two the nightly repair never does.

**Source health and the extension engine** (since v0.49.0). The `sources` check reads the per-stage evidence
(#115): each of its items adds `evidence` (one line per stage, `search`, `chapters`, `pages`, `images`, each
`{stage, state: 'ok' | 'fail' | 'unknown', at, by: 'test' | 'sweep' | 'traffic', kind: 'error' | 'empty' |
'unnumbered', error}`), `tested` (the last Test or daily check: `{at, by, state: 'pass' | 'fail' | 'inconclusive',
stage}`), `diagnosis` (`{code, reason, fix}`, the admin half) and `series` (how many series use the source), and
its `title` is the source's name (its id only when no name is known). A confirmed failure — a failed live check, or
three failures in a row at one stage from traffic — is a finding whether or not a series uses the source, and an
ignore of it covers the stages failing when it was made; a test that ran out of time and a failure unchecked for
seven days are `info`. The check itself carries `testMs`, how long one Test may take (`SOURCE_TEST_TIMEOUT_MS` plus
8 s), for a client's clock. A new check, `extension-engine`, is there when an engine is set up or series depend on
one: `ok` while it is off on purpose (one `info` item counting those series), `warn` with exactly one item while it
does not answer, and otherwise whether its own Cloudflare helper is in use — an item with the new action
`engine_solver` (`POST /api/admin/extensions/solver`) when the helper is off or points at `localhost`, a finding
only while an extension source is seen behind Cloudflare. When the engine's setting cannot be read (just now, or
ever, on an engine too old to report it) while a source fails with the engine's own *Cloudflare bypass currently
disabled*, the check is `warn` with the summary *It cannot use its Cloudflare helper*, and `engine_solver` where
there is a setting to write and a helper (`FLARESOLVERR_URL`) to share. A `frozen-series` item for an extension
series now names the engine when it is the reason (*can't be reached because the extension engine isn't answering*
/ *is off*).

**Chapter numbering and the slow archive** (since v0.49.0). A new check, `numbering` (#116, *Chapter numbering*),
lists the series whose numbering has something to say, each item with `seriesId` and `sourceId` (the numbering
source, `sw:<id>` for an extension). Findings: a numbering change waiting for review — the detector's proposal
(`renumber`, `keep_numbers`), an admin's choice not applied yet, or a remap an extension setting queued
(`renumber`); a renumber whose journal is still open — being applied, or cut off by a restart, which the series'
next check finishes — with no action; and a series whose source the detector only suspects of giving different
posts one number (`renumber`, `keep_numbers`). As `info`: a series the detector numbered by posting order on its
own in the last 14 days (`keep_numbers`), and one an admin kept on its source's numbers against a strong verdict
(`renumber`). `renumber` is the plan, `GET /api/admin/series/:id/numbering`, then its `POST` with `confirm: true`;
`keep_numbers` is the `POST` with `mode: 'source'`, which renames nothing on a proposal and answers
`needs_confirm` with the plan back on a series already renumbered. The check is absent when no series has
anything to say about its numbering.

A gap the series' slow archive (#117) is going to fetch is the archive's. A gaps item whose every gap it is fetching
is `info`, with `outcome.why: 'archiving'` and no `fixed`; the nightly repair's gap step leaves alone a series whose
every gap it will fetch; and any gaps item with a gap the archive will fetch carries the caveat `{action: 'fill',
code: 'archiving'}`, because `fill` fetches those numbers at once, at the normal pace (at most 20 a press, from the
sources the series follows), instead of leaving them to the archive.

`GET /api/admin/sources` (admin) is every source's stored health, and since v0.49.0 adds, per source, `live`
(the last Test or daily check: `{at, by, state, stage, code, checks}`, or `null`), `failing` (the stages whose
failure is open, confirmed and not stale: `{stage, since, at, error, kind, by, streak}`) and `evidence` (the
same stage lines as Health), plus a top-level `testMs`. The public `status` it carries is unchanged: Admin →
Providers shows *Failing* by overlaying `failing` on it, while `GET /api/sources` stays one answer for every
account.

**Trigger a library scan** (admin scope)

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" https://your-server/api/admin/library/scan
```

It answers the scan's counts `{series, books, ms, skipped}` and, since v0.49.0, stamps the Tasks panel's
*Library scan* line as `POST /api/refresh` does. `POST /api/refresh` (the admin home's *Scan library now*)
rescans at most once a minute server-wide — within a minute it answers `{scanned: false, reason:
'rate_limited'}` — and since v0.49.0 answers an admin `{scanned: true, libraries, series, books, ms, skipped}` in
owned mode. Anyone else gets `{scanned: true, libraries}`: the counts are the whole library's, libraries a member
cannot open included. Both refresh the stored Health summary the header reads (coalesced, at most once every
30 s).

## 18+ libraries and sources

A library whose `age_rating` is 18 or higher is left out of every **listing** endpoint by default: the home
rails, `POST /api/series/search`, genres, collections, favourites, updates, history, bookmarks, notes,
wrapped and the OPDS feeds. Add `?adult=1` to a request to include it. Admins are not exempt, because this is about what
appears unasked rather than about permission -- `max_age_rating` is the permission and is unrelated.

It is deliberately **not** applied to endpoints that resolve one id you already hold: the series page, its
chapter list, `GET /api/books/:id`, its pages, the offline manifest, next/previous, `PUT
/api/books/:id/progress`, `/opds/book/:id/file`, and (since v0.46.0) `POST /api/sources/fill/scan` and `POST
/api/sources/fetch` for the series they name all work whether or not the library is hidden. A filter that
refused to record what you read would lose data rather than tidy a screen; the last two used to answer 404 for a
hidden series, so "Find missing chapters" disappeared with the chip off.

**Since v0.46.0 an admin can widen what the same default hides** (Admin → Settings → 18+ filter): named
**genres** take a series off every listing as though it sat in an 18+ library -- matched case-blind against the
series' genres, or the admin's genre override when it has one, and a per-series *Always show* (`adultExempt` on
`PUT /api/admin/series/:id/meta`) lets one title through -- and named **sources** are treated like sources whose
extension declares `isNsfw`, below. The lists are read in SQL from `server_settings`, never interpolated, and they
reach every surface the default does: listings, OPDS, the Komga-compatible API, notification digests, and the
automatic source hunt, which never follows a named source onto a series that is not itself adult. They widen
what is hidden and never what is allowed: `max_age_rating` stays the only permission.
Since v0.50.0 a series rated 18+ itself (its own rating, or the admin's override) is hidden like one in an 18+
library, and *Always show* lets a title through all three rules — the library's rating, its own and its genres.
It is a shelf switch, not a permission: an account capped below the series' rating still cannot see it.

**Since v0.42.0 the same default covers Discover's sources.** A source whose extension declares itself
adult (`isNsfw`) is a listing like any other, and hiding 18+ libraries while painting twelve adult
providers' covers on the browse screen was issue #64. The rule now reaches `GET /api/sources` (the provider
list), `GET /api/sources/search` for one named source, `GET /api/sources/search-all` (it is not even
**asked**, so no outbound request goes to it and nothing it answered for another account is read back),
`GET /api/sources/latest`, `GET /api/sources/popular` and `GET /api/sources/find` (naming a hidden source
in `?sources=` does not bring it back -- that parameter only narrows the fan-out). The three source routes
that resolve something you named are deliberately **exempt**, for the same reason the series page is:
`POST /api/sources/fill/scan`, `GET /api/sources/detail` and `POST /api/sources/add`. A series whose own
source is adult has to stay fillable and fetchable while the chip is off, or the filter would break the
library rather than tidy a screen.

A hidden source is **hidden, not refused**: `/search`, `/latest` and `/popular` answer `200 { "content":
[] }` -- the same answer a disabled source gives -- because the hide is a preference the same account can
turn off, while the age cap is a permission and still answers `403 forbidden` by id whatever `adult` says.

`GET /api/sources` also reports **`hiddenAdult`**: how many sources you may reach but are not being shown,
i.e. how many `?adult=1` would add back. It is 0 with `adult=1`, and 0 for an account capped below 18 --
those sources were already gone before the count was taken, and a capped account is not told the number.
Discover renders the *Show 18+* chip when `hiddenAdult` is above 0, when the reveal is already on, or when
the account holds an 18+ library, so an install with adult providers and no 18+ shelf still has a switch.

OPDS feeds cannot pass the parameter, so the preference lives on the OPDS token instead: `PATCH
/api/opds/token { "showAdult": true }` (also a switch under **Profile → Connections → External readers**). Off by
default, per credential rather than per account, because the phone and the e-reader are different audiences.
Chapter downloads and page streaming work either way; the age cap is a permission and is unaffected.

`GET /api/libraries` reports `adult: true` for such a library so a client can offer the reveal, and drops
any library rated above the caller's own `max_age_rating` entirely.
`GET /api/adult-filter` answers `{ configured: boolean }`: whether Admin → Settings → 18+ filter names any
genre or source, so a client can offer the same reveal on an install with no 18+ library. Only the flag, never
the lists, and always `false` for an account capped below 18.

The Komga-compatible API cannot pass the parameter either, so the same preference lives on the **API
token**: `POST /api/tokens { …, "showAdult": true }` (since v0.38.0; the *Include 18+ content* checkbox in
the mint dialog, off by default; `GET /api/tokens` rows carry `showAdult`). It decides whether 18+ libraries,
and the genres and sources an admin named, appear in `/api/v1/libraries` and the series listings for that token; `/api/v1/series/:id`, its chapters,
pages and progress resolve by id whatever it says, and the age cap is a permission and is unaffected. The
flag changes nothing on `/api/*` proper, where `?adult=1` remains the reveal.

## Notice chapters

Many sources post announcements for readers as a chapter numbered after the latest with a fraction: 100.1,
100.5. An admin can hide them per series type. `PATCH /api/admin/settings {hideNoticeTypes: [...]}` takes any of
`manga`, `manhwa`, `manhua`, `webtoon`, `comic` and `unknown`, replaced whole. It is read back as
`hide_notice_types`, and an empty list (the default) is off. A single series overrides its type's switch with
`PATCH /api/admin/series/:id {hideNotices: true | false | null}`, where `null` follows the type. The answer
carries `hideNotices`, `hideNoticesEffective` and `hiddenNotices` (how many chapters that hides now).

A series' type is `seriesType` on `GET /api/series/:id` for admins (`unknown` when nothing is known), with
`detectedType {type, from}` naming the evidence. Most trusted first, the evidence is:

1. `genre`: a genre naming the origin.
2. `source`: MangaDex's original language.
3. `anilist`: the country of origin.
4. `webtoon`: a Webtoon genre with nothing better.

`PUT /api/admin/series/:id/meta {seriesType}` overrides the type, and `null` goes back to automatic.

For a series that hides them, every chapter whose effective number (the admin's renumber when there is one) is
not a whole number is left out of everything:

- **Chapter reads:** the chapter list, `GET /api/books/:id` (404), next and previous, pages, the offline manifest,
  Continue Reading, Updates, history and bookmarks.
- **Counts:** `booksCount` and the unread, read and new counts.
- **Listings:** the series page's missing-chapter rows, groups and versions.
- **External surfaces:** OPDS, the Komga-compatible API and the tracker push.
- **Downloads:** the updater, the slow archive and `source_missing`. Neither the updater nor the slow archive
  downloads one.

Nothing is deleted, and the listing keeps every number. Turning a switch off applies on the next request, and
the next check downloads what it no longer hides.

## Rate limiting

The API isn't rate-limited for authenticated users; the limits are on getting in. `POST /auth/login` takes
ten attempts per address per five minutes, `POST /api/setup` and `POST /auth/register` five per ten minutes,
and the Komga-compatible routes count failed credentials on the login budget — ten per address per five
minutes, then **429** `too_many_requests` `{message}` with `Retry-After` for every further request from that
address that presents a credential, until the window ends; requests with no credential, cookie-only
requests and valid keys are not counted. The *sources* the server fetches from are limited too: endpoints
that reach out to a manga site (`/api/sources/*`, `/api/admin/update`) queue behind a per-source limiter, so
a burst of requests will be slow rather than refused. Don't poll them in a tight loop.

## Full route list

Grouped by the module that serves them. Anything under `/api/admin/` needs an admin account **and** the
`admin` scope.

### Health
```
GET    /livez                     GET    /healthz
```
The two unauthenticated routes. Both answer before login exists, and they mean different things:

- **`/livez`** answers `{"ok":true}` unconditionally — is the process alive. This is what the container
  healthcheck polls, so that a database blip does not mark the whole app unhealthy.
- **`/healthz`** runs `SELECT 1` and returns **503** when Postgres is unreachable — should traffic be sent
  here. This is the one for a load balancer or an uptime monitor that should page you.

Point a reverse proxy's own health check at `/livez` if you want it to keep serving the shell during a
database outage, and at `/healthz` if you want it to take the app out of rotation instead.

### Authentication and setup
```
GET    /api/setup/status          POST   /api/setup
GET    /auth/config               POST   /auth/login
POST   /auth/register             POST   /auth/refresh
POST   /auth/logout               POST   /auth/logout-all
GET    /auth/me                   POST   /auth/password
GET    /auth/sessions             DELETE /auth/sessions/:id
POST   /auth/totp/setup           POST   /auth/totp/enable
POST   /auth/totp/disable
GET    /auth/oidc/start             GET    /auth/oidc/callback
```

**Two-factor enrolment is one way.** `POST /auth/totp/setup` writes a *pending* secret and answers
`{secret, otpauth, qr}`; nothing is enforced until `POST /auth/totp/enable` `{code}` confirms a code from
the app and answers the recovery codes once. While two-factor is already on, setup is **409**
`{error: 'totp_enabled', message}` and the row is not touched (since v0.39.0): the secret in the row is
the one the authenticator holds, and rotating it from a stale *Set up 2FA* button left the flag on and the
app's codes wrong. `POST /auth/totp/disable` `{password}` is the way back (**401** `wrong_password`), and
setup works again after it.

### Library and reading
```
GET    /api/home                  GET    /api/featured
GET    /api/foryou                GET    /api/trending
GET    /api/random                GET    /api/genres
GET    /api/genres/overview       GET    /api/libraries
GET    /api/library/sources       GET    /api/adult-filter
GET    /api/updates               POST   /api/updates/seen
POST   /api/refresh
GET    /api/series/:id            GET    /api/series/:id/books
GET    /api/series/:id/similar    GET    /api/series/:id/color
POST   /api/series/search         GET    /api/leaderboard
GET    /api/books/:id             GET    /api/books/:id/pages
GET    /api/books/:id/next        PUT    /api/books/:id/progress
PUT    /api/books/:id/pages/:n/junk
GET    /api/offline/plan             GET    /api/series/:id/listing
GET    /api/series/:id/groups        GET    /api/series/:id/versions
POST   /api/series/:id/listing-progress
DELETE /api/series/:id/listing-progress
```

**Filtering the library by source** (since v0.49.2; the filters are @TIGamingTV's, PR #124). On the owned
backend, `POST /api/series/search` accepts two more conditions: `mainSource` (the source a series was added from,
by id) and `anySource` (that, or a source it follows as a fallback). Both take `is` / `isNot`, and a source whose
extension is gone still filters.
`GET /api/library/sources` lists `{id, name, main, any, installed}` for every source the viewer's library
comes from, busiest first: `main` counts the series added from it, `any` the series that read from it at all.
It is counted over what the viewer may list, so the numbers match the filtered grid, and it is empty on a
Komga backend. `name` is the one Health uses: the loaded source's, else the name the extension engine gave it,
else the id; `installed` is false while a source is not loaded (its extension gone or switched off, or the
engine down).

**Language editions of one work** (since v0.52.0, #72). Blue Lock in English and in Spanish are two series —
each with its own folder, chapters, sources and reading progress — linked as editions of one work. Every series
DTO carries `lang` (the BCP-47 code it is in: its own, else its main source's declared language, else the
server's unstated language, English by default; also `metadata.language`), `workId` (or null), and from the list
routes `edition: {langs} | null`, the work's languages the caller may browse. `GET /api/series/:id` carries
`edition: {workId, editions: [{seriesId, lang, title, booksCount, current, lastRead}]} | null` instead, the
editions the caller may open, oldest first; admins also get `langStated` and `langAuto` (what "Automatic"
means). `POST /api/series/search {collapseEditions: true}` (the Library grid) answers one series per work — the
edition the caller read last, else the oldest — and counts works in `totalElements`. An edition is added with
`POST /api/sources/add {edition: {of, lang?, ofLang?}}` into its own folder, `<source>/<title> (<LANG>)`; `GET
/api/sources/edition-candidates ?seriesId=` lists the languages the sources offer and, with `&lang=`, searches
them for the work. Discover's `inLibrary` now means held in that source's language, with `libraryLangs` beside
it, and a `duplicate` from a source in a new language carries the offer `edition: {of, heldLangs, lang}`. Admins
link two series already here with `POST /api/admin/series/:id/editions {with, lang?, withLang?}` (Health's "Link
as editions" on a duplicate pair in two languages), unlink with `DELETE /api/admin/series/:id/edition`, and
state a series' language with `PATCH /api/admin/series/:id {lang}`. The age rating set in Edit details is the
work's, a merge inside one work is refused (`same_work`), and a work left with one edition — by an unlink, a
merge or a forget — dissolves. The Komga-compatible API and OPDS keep every edition a series of its own and
title it with its code, "Blue Lock (ES-419)", while a sibling is in the caller's sight; a tracker push never
goes below what another series on the same tracker entry has sent.

**Mark caught up** (since v0.52.0, from discussion #72). `PATCH /api/admin/series/:id {chapterFloor:
'caught_up'}` floors a series just above the newest chapter its sources list or the library holds, as a
"Nothing yet" add does: the back catalogue is not fetched, every later release is. The answer's
`chapterFloor: {floor, previous}` is the Undo: `{chapterFloor: previous}` (a number, or null) puts the old floor
back.

**Where things are on disk** (since v0.52.0, #136, admins only). `GET /api/series/:id` carries `paths`, the
series' folder as full paths on the server — one per root its chapters are under — and each chapter of `GET
/api/series/:id/books` its file's `path`.

**Where a series and its chapters came from.** `GET /api/series/:id` carries `sources`, primary first, then
any source the series has been followed on (`POST /api/admin/series/:id/sources`, below); each entry is
`{sourceId, name, sourceSeriesId, primary, checkedAt, chapters, registered, auto}`, where `registered` says
whether that adapter is loaded right now and `auto` whether the add-time auto-follow chose it rather than a
person (always `false` for the primary; a person confirming the same source through a plan turns it
`false`). Admins additionally get `scanlatorPrefs`: the series' own release
preferences, or `null` when it has none and the server-wide ones apply; and `sourcePrefs`, the series' own
source order `{priority}` (below), or `null` when the server-wide order applies.

**Which way a series reads** (since v0.48.0). `metadata.readingDirection` is one of Komga's four —
`LEFT_TO_RIGHT`, `RIGHT_TO_LEFT`, `VERTICAL`, `WEBTOON` — and was `WEBTOON` for every series before. It is now the
admin's override (`readingDirection` on `PUT /api/admin/series/:id/meta`, echoed as `overrides.readingDirection`)
if there is one, else what the evidence said, else still `WEBTOON`. The evidence, most trusted first: the first
chapter's `ComicInfo.xml` saying `<Manga>YesAndRightToLeft</Manga>` (read by every scan); the followed source —
MangaDex's original language, Japanese → `RIGHT_TO_LEFT`, Korean and Chinese → `WEBTOON`, read when a series is
added and by the repair's `directions` step; and AniList's country of origin by the same rule, from the match that
finds the art and from a tracker link. A weaker signal never replaces a stronger one. Admins also get
`detectedDirection: {direction, from} | null`, what the evidence alone says. The same value reaches the reader's
*Series default* direction, the offline download manifest and the Komga-compatible API.

Every chapter object (this route's
`books`, `GET /api/books/:id`, `next`, the home shelves) carries `scanlator` — the group that released the
file on disk, as the source showed it, a joint release reading `"A & B"` — and `sourceId`, the adapter it was
downloaded from. Both are `null` for a chapter the scanner found rather than the downloader wrote, which
includes everything downloaded before v0.31.0. The same group name is written into the file's
`ComicInfo.xml` as `<Translator>`.

Two more flags on every chapter object since v0.32.0: `owned` — the file lives in the download directory,
so it is one this server fetched and could fetch again (the only chapters the delete and re-fetch actions
below will touch) — and `pruned` — the file was deleted by the read-chapter cleanup or by an admin, and the
row is a tombstone: reading progress is still attached, but there are no pages behind it. A pruned chapter
is listed by `GET /api/series/:id/books` (with the flag) and skipped everywhere a chapter is *served*:
`next`, Continue reading, the OPDS feed, the offline plan; its download manifest answers **410** `pruned`.

Since v0.40.0 every chapter object also carries `missingPages: number[] | null`: 1-based indices whose
images are repair placeholders in a partial chapter. `GET /api/books/:id/pages` keeps those entries in
place and adds `missing: true`; a page may be both `missing` and `junk`, and a reader must not hide the
missing placeholder. `GET /api/books/:id/download-manifest` copies the same optional `missing: true` onto
each affected entry in `pages`, so offline readers preserve the evidence. A complete chapter has
`missingPages: null` and no page-level `missing` keys.

**Chapters the sources have that you don't.** `GET /api/series/:id/listing` answers
`{checkedAt, content: [Ghost]}`: every chapter number the series' sources listed at the last check (the
sweep, or **Check now**) that this server has no row for, each with the reason —
`Ghost = {number, title, publishedAt, scanlator, groups, sourceId, sourceName, why, attempts?, reason?,
waitingFor?, waitDaysLeft?, read?}`, `why` one of `missing` (not fetched yet), `held` (waiting for a preferred
group under the release preferences), `failed` (the sweep gave up after the retry cap; `attempts` says how
many tries), `blocked` (only blocked groups have released it), `floor` (below the series' Latest-N floor),
`covered` (since v0.50.0: another site's split of a chapter this server holds — a number not on disk, at a whole
number the disk holds a file at, from a source none of those files came from — or, with nothing of that chapter on
disk yet, a part listed only by sources other than the first-ranked one that lists the chapter; the sweep never
fetches it and it is not counted in `source_missing`, but `POST /api/sources/fetch` still takes it).
A `held` ghost also carries `waitingFor` (since v0.34.0) — the effective first-choice group it is being
held for, the series' own priority over the global one, minus anything blocked — and `waitDaysLeft`, the
whole days until the patience window closes, counted as the sweep counts it: from the oldest hosted copy
that is not from a blocked group, under today's preferences (so it can read 0 on a row the last sweep held
before a preference change; both are absent when no priority group survives the blocklist). The listing is read from what the updater
persisted, never from the sources on a page open, so `checkedAt` is how old the answer is; a source that
failed to answer leaves the previous listing standing. `reason`, the downloader's last error text, is
present for admins only. A tombstone is a row, so it is never a ghost. Since v0.43.0 a chapter matches its
listing number by its *override-aware* number (an admin's correction wins over the filename), so a chapter
renumbered from 0 to 105 is no longer also a ghost at 105; and `read: true` is present on a ghost the caller
marked read (below) — absent, never `false`, for everyone else.

**Marking chapters you don't have read** (since v0.43.0). `POST /api/series/:id/listing-progress {numbers}`
marks chapter numbers read for the caller, and `DELETE` on the same path with the same body marks them unread
(1–500 numbers, each 0–1,000,000; **400** otherwise, **404** for a series the caller cannot open). Each number
is resolved in one pass: a number a chapter row holds — by its override-aware number, a deleted chapter's row
included — is marked on that row exactly as the library's bulk mark-read does (`viaBook`); a number the listing
above has and no row holds becomes a read *mark* (`marked`); anything else is skipped as `not_listed`, because
the listing is the authorisation, as it is for a fetch. The POST answers `{ok, marked, viaBook, skipped:
[{number, reason: 'not_listed'}]}`, the DELETE `{ok, unmarked, viaBook}`. Re-marking keeps the first mark's
time. The DELETE is not checked against the listing — it only removes the caller's own rows, and a mark can
outlive the listing row it was made on. Neither writes a reading event, so stats, streaks, the household
leaderboard and Wrapped do not move, and neither needs the download permission: a mark costs no bytes. When a
marked chapter later lands on the server, the scan turns the mark into ordinary read progress on it, stamped
with the mark's time — clamped to just before the file's own time, so the read-chapter cleanup never takes a
file the sweep has just fetched. A merge carries marks to the surviving series (the earlier of two marks on
one number wins), **Forget** deletes them and counts their owner among the members who lose history, and the
library's bulk **mark unread** clears them too; bulk **mark read** and the series page's **Mark all read**
never create them. After a POST that changed something, the trackers get ONE push for the series (one that
only added marks pushes only with the Komga ghost-chapters setting on, since marks count for nothing without
it) — and a mark reaches AniList, MyAnimeList or Kitsu only as part of a *contiguous* run of read chapters
from the start, only with the Komga ghost-chapters setting on (below), never as a lone tick: real chapters read to 12 plus one mark
on 1000 still sends 12, while marks on 13–200 behind them send 200. A DELETE pushes nothing; the tracker stays
ahead, the safe direction.

**Translated by.** `GET /api/series/:id/groups` answers `{checkedAt, content: [GroupStat]}`, one entry
per scanlation group, sorted by releases descending:
`GroupStat = {name, releases, first, last, lastReleaseAt, cadence: {kind, intervalDays, daysSince, quiet},
onDisk, chapters, langs, weeks}`. `releases` counts the chapters the group released — distinct numbers across every
followed source, so a second copy of a number (a follower listing it too, a re-upload) is not a second release,
while a joint release counts once for each of its groups; `chapters` are the numbers it released, ascending, with
`first`/`last` the ends of that list; `onDisk` is how many live chapters on this server are stamped with the
group; `langs` the languages its copies are in. `cadence.kind` comes from the median gap between the group's
last ten release *days* (a day with several chapters is one release day, so a group that ships two at a time
is weekly, not daily) — `daily` (≤ 1.5 days), `weekly` (≤ 9), `monthly` (≤ 40), `irregular`, or `unknown`
with fewer than two distinct dated days — and `quiet` is true when the silence since `lastReleaseAt` exceeds
three intervals (never less than 14 days), or 45 days when the rhythm is unknown. `weeks` (since v0.34.0)
is twelve booleans, oldest first, newest last — index 11 is the seven days ending now — true for each week
the group released in, from the same dates; the series page draws them as an activity strip. Groups are
merged by the same equality the release rules use; the name shown is the first spelling seen on disk, else
the first listed. Since v0.33.0 the listing keeps *every* copy the sources list, not only the chosen one,
and this is read from those copies plus the file stamps — never from the sources on a page open, so
`checkedAt` is how old the answer is. Any account that can open the series may read it; ranking and blocking
is the admin route below.

**Chapter versions.** `GET /api/series/:id/versions` answers `{checkedAt, content: [{number, copies: [Copy]}]}`
for every listed number, `Copy = {key, source, sourceName, groups, scanlator, lang, pages, publishedAt,
chosen, blocked, onDisk}` — `key` is `<source>:<sourceId>`; `chosen` marks the copy the release rules picked
at the last check; `blocked` means every group on the copy is blocked by the effective preferences (a copy
with no groups is never blocked); `onDisk` is best effort — a live chapter for the number came from the same
source with the same group stamp, or, for a file with no stamp, this is the chosen copy. A `source` and
`sourceId` from here make a *pick* (below). A number listed before v0.33.0 has `copies: []` until its next
check.

### Sources
```
GET    /api/sources               GET    /api/sources/find
GET    /api/sources/detail        GET    /api/sources/search
GET    /api/sources/search-all    GET    /api/sources/latest
GET    /api/sources/jobs          POST   /api/sources/add
GET    /api/discover/trending     POST   /api/sources/fill/scan
GET    /api/sources/fill/scan/:id POST   /api/sources/fill
POST   /api/sources/fetch
GET    /api/sources/archive       POST   /api/sources/archive
GET    /api/sources/edition-candidates
POST   /api/sources/archive/:seriesId/pause
POST   /api/sources/archive/:seriesId/resume
DELETE /api/sources/archive/:seriesId
```

**Filling a series' gaps.** `POST /api/sources/fill/scan` takes `{seriesId, altTitle?}` and answers with what
is missing, a short-lived `planId`, and every source that was checked — including the ones it refused, with
the reason and the measured overlap. `POST /api/sources/fill` then takes
`{planId, source, sourceSeriesId, numbers[]}`.

Since v0.48.4 the scan answers as it goes. A source behind Cloudflare can take 90 s to answer, and a scan
that waited for the slowest source outlasted the timeout of the reverse proxy in front of it. The POST
starts the scan, or joins the one the same person is already running for the same series and title, and
answers after `SCAN_FIRST_ANSWER_MS` (2.5 s) with what has arrived: `done`, `scanId`, the candidates so far,
`asking` (the sources it is waiting for, `{source, name}`) and `waiting` (how many have not had a turn).
`GET /api/sources/fill/scan/:id` answers the same shape with the rest, to the person who started the scan
only (`404 scan_gone` to anyone else, and once a finished scan has aged out with its plan). `refusal` comes
with `done`. The plan is usable while the scan runs: a candidate appears only once its chapters are in it.
One person may run three scans at once; a fourth answers `429 busy`.

The split is deliberate. Chapter URLs never leave the server: the client names chapter NUMBERS, and only ones
that the quoted plan actually offered for that source. A chapter fetched from the wrong series would land as
`Chapter <n>.cbz` exactly where the right one belongs and look identical in every listing, so nothing is
fetched until a person has been shown which source, which title on it, and how many chapters.

The scan's answer also carries `following`: the source ids the series is already followed on, so a client
can mark a candidate as followed instead of offering to follow it twice (present on the `too_few_chapters`
early answer as well). Each candidate's `count`, `first` and `last` describe one copy per chapter number,
chosen under the series' release preferences with the patience switched off, so a fill of `[n]` lands one
file even when the source lists chapter `n` from three groups. `GET /api/sources/detail` counts the same
way, under the server-wide preferences, so the "120 chapters" the add dialog shows is the 120 the add would
land and not the 200 rows the source listed. Since v0.33.0 the detail also carries `groups: [GroupStat]`
(who translates it, from the same chapter list — no second source call, `onDisk` 0) and `versions`, how many
numbers the source lists in more than one copy. Its `summary` is plain text: HTML and Markdown are stripped
(MangaDex describes in Markdown), link text kept. The same strip is applied to the description an add
writes into the ComicInfo and, since v0.34.0, to every series' `metadata.summary` on the way out of
`GET /api/series/:id` and the listings — so a series added before v0.34.0 whose stored summary still holds
`**Year:** 1997 ---` reads clean without a migration.

**Fetching ghost chapters.** `POST /api/sources/fetch {seriesId, numbers?[], picks?[], floored?}` (at least one of
the two, at most 300 combined; numbers 0–1,000,000) fetches chapters from the listing above. What authorises a fetch is the *listing*: a client
names chapter numbers, and only a number the sources list has anything to fetch from — the same footing
as the fill plan, and for the same reason (no chapter URL ever crosses the wire). The listing is refreshed
first (a check with no downloads), so what is fetched is the copy the release rules choose *now* — a group
ranked a minute ago counts; a source that does not answer leaves the last listing standing. A `held`
number is fetched regardless of patience, because a person clicking Fetch on a "waiting for group B" row
is saying they will take it, but the blocklist is never ignored — a `blocked` number has no copy to fetch;
unblock the group and check again. A manual fetch resets the chapter's retry cap. With `floored: true` (since
v0.48.3) `numbers` are whole chapters: 12 takes every listed chapter from 12 up to 13, so 12 and 12.5 — the
numbers the fill scan reports, which is what the Find missing chapters dialog sends. The answer is
`{ok, started, folder, total, skipped: [{number, reason}]}` with `reason` one of `not_listed` (run
**Check for new chapters** first), `blocked_group`, `already_here` (a live chapter, not a tombstone),
`source_unavailable` (adapter not loaded or disabled, or a source the series no longer follows), `cooldown`,
`over_cap` (with `floored`, a chapter past the 300 the expansion reached — press again for the rest);
**409** `nothing_to_fetch` (with `skipped`) when nothing is fetchable, **409** `busy` while a download for
that series is running — since v0.37.0 that includes the series a bulk *Fetch newest* run is currently
inside, for that one series and only while the run is on it (the same test guards `/api/sources/fill` and
the admin `chapters/refetch`); the rest of the library is not locked — **404** for a series the caller
cannot see. Same permission gate as the fill:
`canDownload: false` is refused by the whole `/api/sources` surface, and a source outside the account's
age cap answers **403**. Progress is on `GET /api/sources/jobs` under the series' `folder`.

**Download progress.** Since v0.40.0 a job may carry `switched: [{number, from, to, why?}]`, one entry for
each chapter completed from a different followed source after its first copy failed. `why` is
`"rate_limited"` when that was the reason for the switch; it may be absent for an ordinary failure. It may
also carry `partial`, the count of chapters this job saved with repair placeholders. Both fields are
additive and absent when their count is zero. An explicitly pinned copy never switches. A 403/429 refusal
never becomes a partial chapter or starts a source hunt; a copy from an already-followed source may still
land, with `why: "rate_limited"` when appropriate.

**Picks — fetching one specific version.** `picks: [{number, source, sourceId}]` names copies out of
`GET /api/series/:id/versions` instead of numbers. A pick is authorised by a matching entry among the
number's stored copies — `not_listed` otherwise, and the skipped entry then carries the `source` and
`sourceId` asked for — and its source must be followed and available (`source_unavailable`, `cooldown`)
exactly as for a number. What a pick does *not* go through is the group rules, **the blocklist included**:
the blocklist governs what the sweep takes on its own, the versions list labels a copy `blocked`, and a
person who taps Fetch on it anyway has chosen that one copy on purpose. What a pick never overrides is
`already_here`: a live chapter for the number is replaced by the admin's re-fetch, not by a member naming
another copy. A number named in both lists is fetched as its pick; a second pick for the same number is
skipped as `duplicate` (the first was handled, this one was not). The audit line (`series.chapters_fetch`)
carries `picks`.

### Bulk actions
```
POST   /api/library/bulk/read     POST   /api/favorites/bulk
POST   /api/collections/:id/items/bulk
POST   /api/library/bulk/newest   GET    /api/library/bulk/newest
```
The first three take `{ seriesIds: [...] }`, up to 500. An id that no longer exists is reported in `skipped`
rather than failing the batch. Marking read deliberately writes no reading events, so importing a backlog
does not inflate streaks or the leaderboard.

**Fetch newest** (since v0.37.0) is the one bulk action that fetches bytes from sources, so it is a detached
job rather than a request that waits, and it carries the download gate the whole of `/api/sources` sits
behind. `POST /api/library/bulk/newest {ids: [...]}` — 1 to 500 series ids of 1–64 characters, duplicates
counted once — starts it and answers **202** `{ok: true, total}` at once (`total` = distinct ids asked). A
member whose `canDownload` permission is off (or whose account row cannot be read — it fails closed; admins
are exempt, an absent permission allows) gets **403** `forbidden` *You don't have permission to download
chapters.*; a body that is not `ids` (the old `seriesIds` key included) is **400** `bad_request` *ids: one to
five hundred series ids.*; while a run is going, **409** `busy` *A Fetch newest run is already going. Wait
for it to finish.* — one run per server, never queued. Ids the caller cannot see (hidden, merged, in a
library they are not granted, nonexistent) are not an error: they go into the run as `skipped` *Not in your
library.* and count towards `total`. One `download.bulk_newest` audit row per start, `{count, asked}`. The
run is not refused while the nightly sweep is going (a sweep can take hours); the downloader skips a file
already on disk, so the worst overlap is one listing asked twice.

The rule, per series: take the **newest release the series' sources list** (the maximum across every
followed source, chosen by the release preferences) and nothing else. If a live row holds it the series is
`up_to_date`; if the shelf holds it only as a tombstone the read-chapter cleanup, *Delete from server* or
*Delete files* left (`pruned_reason` NULL or `'deleted'`, no live row beside it) the series is `skipped` —
those bytes went by someone's decision, and the reason names the way back — while a `'missing'` tombstone
from the verify task is not held and is fetched; otherwise that one number is fetched with the series'
*latest N* floor ignored for it alone (the floor is never moved, and nothing below it is fetched, so a
caught-up Latest-N series answers up to date rather than back-filling), the retry-cap ledger for that number
cleared first as the series page's *Fetch* does. A number held for a preferred group is honoured, not
overridden (a bulk button is not a per-copy pick); a source the account's age limit excludes, a source in a
cooldown, and a source listing nothing are each skipped with their reason. A source the admin disabled is
never asked for its listing: a series whose every source is disabled is skipped at once with no network
call, and one that also follows a live source is asked on that one only. A file already on disk without a
row is scanned in and reads up to date. Only after a source was actually asked does the job pause the
sweep's 1.5 s before the next series — ids not in the library, disabled sources and cooldowns are not
paced; one library scan runs at the end, then dates and provenance are stamped on every landed chapter.
While the run is inside a series, that series' folder reads busy to `POST /api/sources/fetch`,
`/api/sources/fill` and the admin `chapters/refetch` (**409** `busy`), and to nothing else.

`GET /api/library/bulk/newest` always answers **200** `{running, done, total, startedAt, results:
[{id, title, outcome, reason?}]}` — the current run, or the last one (in memory: a restart forgets it; before
any run everything is zero, `startedAt` null, `results` empty). `outcome` is `downloaded`, `up_to_date`,
`skipped` or `failed`; `reason` is a sentence, present on every outcome but `downloaded` (*Chapter 12 is
already here.* — a live row holds it; *Chapter 12 was already on disk and is in the library now.*; *Chapter
12 was deleted from this server on purpose. Fetch again on the series page brings it back.* — `skipped`, the
newest chapter is a cleanup or Delete-files tombstone with no live row, nothing is fetched and the tombstone
is untouched; *Chapter 12 is being held for the preferred group. Pick a copy on the series page to take it
now.*, *Its source is disabled by the admin.*, *That source is not available on this account.*, *Its source
lists no chapters.*, *No source is installed for this series.*, *Its source is in a cooldown. Try again
later.*, *Not in your library.*, *A download for that series is already running.*, *The server is shutting
down.*, *Its source did not answer.*, *Chapter 12 could not be saved. The Health page has the details.*, *The
library disk is full.*); `title` is `""` for an id outside the caller's library. `results` are in the order
the ids were given, which is the order they were started, and they are returned only to the account that
started the run and to admins — every other member gets the counts with `results: []`, since a title from a
library they were not granted must not leak through someone else's selection. A server shutdown ends the run
between series; the rest read `skipped` *The server is shutting down.*

**Progress trackers.** `GET /api/trackers` is the caller's own connections, every provider listed connected
or not; `POST /api/trackers/:provider/connect` takes a pasted token and `DELETE /api/trackers/:provider`
drops it. A push goes out for the caller alone when they finish a chapter of a linked series, never below
the floor `tracker_progress` holds for them (see the reviewable import under Admin, `/run`). Only a **401**
from the service — or AniList's "Invalid token" **400** — is a verdict on the token, and disables the
connection with `last_error` = `the tracker rejected the saved token -- reconnect to resume syncing`; a
**403** (Cloudflare in front of AniList, MyAnimeList's request block, a forbidden Kitsu action) is recorded
as a plain sync error and retried on the next chapter, the connection kept. A token past its `expires_at`
is not sent: `last_error` reads `the access token has expired -- reconnect to resume syncing`, connection
kept. `POST /api/trackers/:provider/resync/:seriesId` is the one deliberate way **down**: it deletes the
caller's floor for that series on **that provider** only (`anilist`, `myanimelist` or `kitsu` — any other
name is **404** `unknown_provider`) and pushes the current local count at once, lower or not. No web
control calls it; the app's own repair for a floor the tracker has since corrected is to read the list
again. A local count that drops below a number this app already sent is refused with `last_error` =
`not syncing: this series now works out to chapter N, below the M already sent. Import your list again under
Admin → Import (From your tracker) to take the tracker's current number, or ask an admin to.`

**Server settings.** `GET /api/admin/settings` is the one row: `server_name`, `allow_registration`,
`updater_hours`, `extension_hours`, `extension_auto_update`, `update_check`, `install_ping`, `install_ping_last`,
`cleanup_read`, `cleanup_read_days`, `backup_hour`, `scanlator_prefs`, `auto_follow_on_failure`,
`repair_enabled`, `source_prefs`, `group_upgrade`, `borrow_names`, `mangadex_langs`, `unstated_lang`, plus
`extensions_configured` and `mangadex_available` (computed). `auto_follow_on_failure` defaults to true and
controls the bounded once-per-series-per-day source hunt after an ordinary scheduled-download failure; it
never makes an interactive Add/Fetch hunt and never runs after a refusal. `PATCH
/api/admin/settings` takes any subset of `serverName` (1–64 chars), `allowRegistration`, `updaterHours`
(1–168), `extensionHours` (1–168), `extensionAutoUpdate`, `updateCheck`, `installPing`, `cleanupRead`,
`cleanupReadDays` (0–3650; 0 is a value, "at the next run"), `backupHour` (0–23, the local hour of the nightly
backup — the pending timer is re-armed at once, so the change applies to the next run rather than the one
after; `GET /api/admin/tasks` shows the backup's `schedule` as `daily at HH:00` from the same column),
`scanlatorPrefs` and `sourcePrefs` (both below), `groupUpgrade` (the repair's group upgrades, off by default),
`borrowNames` (chapter names from another source, off by default; switching it off clears the names it wrote),
`hideNoticeTypes` (notice chapters, below),
`autoFollowOnFailure`, and `repairEnabled` (the nightly library repair, on by
default — switching it off stops the schedule only, since nothing it does deletes, merges or renumbers
anything). Since v0.52.0 it also takes `mangadexLangs` and `unstatedLang`: `mangadexLangs` is the MangaDex
languages besides English to switch on, replaced whole, as app codes from `mangadex_available` (every language
MangaDex is offered in, English first; MangaDex's own `es-la`, `pt-br`, `zh`, `zh-hk` are read as `es-419`, `pt-BR`,
`zh-Hans`, `zh-Hant`). It is applied at once: each language turned on is registered as its own source, each turned
off is unregistered, and its series keep their chapters and read as frozen on the Health page until it is back.
English is always on and is refused (**400** `english_always_on`), as is a code MangaDex is not offered in (**400**
`unknown_language`); a change is audited as `settings.mangadex_langs` `{from, to}`. `unstatedLang` is the language
of sources and series that do not say which they are in (English by default, `unstated_lang` on GET): a source is
followed for a series automatically only when both are in the same language. Any one language is accepted and
normalised (`pt-br` is `pt-BR`); `all`, `other` or an empty string is a **400** `unknown_language`. Each field is
written on its own, an out-of-range value is a **400** and nothing is written, and
the audit row `settings.update` carries the body. The admin console's Settings tab sends one
row per PATCH as each row is changed (the read-chapter confirmation carries the day count with the switch).

**Notification targets** (since v0.43.0, Admin → Settings → Notifications) are where notices go besides web
push: `webhook` (a JSON POST `{event, title, message, count, series: [{id, title, added}]}`, optional
`Authorization: Bearer`), `home_assistant` (`{title, message}` to `/api/services/<domain>/<service>` on the
stored origin, rebuilt from a `service` that must match `domain.service` in lower case, digits and `_`),
`ntfy` (the message as text to `<server>/<topic>`, the title in a `Title` header) and `discord` (`{content}`
with mentions switched off). `POST /api/admin/notify-targets` takes `kind`, `name` and what the kind needs
(`url`, `token`, `topic`, `service`) plus `events` (`new_chapters`, `health`; both by default), `template`
(`{count}`, `{series}`, `{list}`; blank is "{count} new chapters in {series}"), `userId` (aim it at one person:
only their favourites, and health notices only if they are an admin), `includeAdult` (name series from 18+
libraries in the digest; `false` by default, like an OPDS link's and an API token's `showAdult` — a target
aimed at a person is bounded by that person's libraries and age cap whatever it says) and `enabled`. Addresses
and tokens are encrypted under a key of their own and **never come back**: every answer is the `NotifyTarget`
shape, whose `target` is scheme and host only; changing one means sending it again in a `PATCH`, and `hasToken`
says whether one is stored. **A stored credential never follows the address to another host**: a `PATCH` whose
`url` lands on another origin is refused with `reenter_token` (a token is stored and none was sent) or, for
ntfy, `reenter_topic`, so re-pointing a target and pressing Test cannot read back a secret; a path change on
the same origin keeps them. The `notify.target.update` audit row carries the new host when the address changed. Private addresses are allowed on purpose (a Home Assistant lives on the LAN); `http(s)` only, no
`user:password@`, and cloud-metadata addresses (169.254.0.0/16, `fe80::/10`, `fd00:ec2::254`,
100.100.100.200, `metadata.google.internal`, `metadata.goog`) are refused at save AND on every DNS answer at
send time, as is this server's own port on loopback or at its own `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`; a redirect is never
followed. Every refusal is a fixed `{error, message}` (`bad_url`,
`blocked_address`, `self_target`, `token_required`, `bad_token`, `bad_service`, `bad_topic`, `bad_discord_url`,
`unknown_user`, `reenter_all`, `reenter_token`, `reenter_topic`) that never repeats what was typed. `POST /api/admin/notify-targets/:id/test`
sends one test message to a SAVED target (an address in the body is ignored), five a minute per admin, and
answers `{ok, status, reason}` with `reason` one of `ok`, `timeout`, `refused`, `dns`, `tls`, `unreachable`,
`unauthorized`, `not_found`, `rate_limited`, `server_error`, `bad_response`, `redirect`, `blocked`,
`secret_unreadable` — never the target's own answer. New chapters go out ONCE per sweep — the scheduled one,
or **Run now** on it (`POST /api/admin/tasks/update/run`) — after it finishes, as one digest per target, and
not at all when nothing landed (a series' own **Check now** sends nothing); health notices go wherever the admins' web
push goes, whether or not push is configured. A delivery is retried once on a network error, a 429 or a 5xx,
never on another 4xx; after 10 consecutive failures the target is switched off and the admins are told once.
The audit rows `notify.target.create` / `.update` / `.delete` / `.test` carry ids, names, the host and the
names of the fields changed — never an address or a token.

The bulk importer's body takes `titles`, `autoUpdate`, `chapterCount` and `chapterFrom`, with the same
meaning as on `/api/sources/add` (`chapterFrom: "newest"` takes the latest N and floors the series; the
importer accepts `oldest` and `newest` only — `none` is the add dialog's).

**Reviewable import** (`/api/admin/import/batches*`, `/api/admin/import/candidates/:cid`) is the same idea
with a match-review step in between, and is what the admin UI uses — the plain importer above adds the
first cross-source hit with no review and stays for scripted callers. `POST .../batches` takes the same
`dataUrl`/`mangadexList`/`titles` intake as `/api/admin/import/parse`, starts matching in the background
(one batch resolves at a time server-wide) and returns `{batchId, total, truncated, skippedNovels}`. It
searches at most 500 titles; since v0.51.0 the titles the library already holds are kept as skipped rows and
do not count toward them, so `total` can be more than 500, and `truncated` says more titles not owned
remained, which importing the same list again picks up once these are in. A
fourth intake, `{origin: 'tracker', tracker: 'anilist' | 'myanimelist' | 'kitsu', statuses?: ('reading' |
'plan_to_read' | 'completed' | 'on_hold' | 'dropped')[]}`, reads the requesting admin's OWN connected
account (the connection `GET /api/trackers` shows for them, never another member's; `statuses` defaults to
reading + plan_to_read) — up to 501 entries, of which the batch keeps 500 (`truncated` when the read hit the
cap); light novels are dropped and counted as `skippedNovels` — both figures are also stored on the batch
row, as `skippedNovels` and `truncated` on every batch `GET` returns; entries are deduped by their id and
by the normalised form of every name they go by, and each row carries `tracker`, `external_id`,
`alt_titles` (romaji and synonyms, at most three, never an abbreviation whose normalised form is shorter
than five characters — "AoT", "SnK", "MHA" — since such a term contains-matches almost any title) and
`progress`. The resolve pass searches the English search title on every source first, then the first
alternate on every source, and so on, so an exact hit for the title on a later source beats a weaker hit
for an alternate on an earlier one; a row matched under an alternate records it as `matched_via`. A
tracker row whose title the library already holds (under the search title or any alt — `matched_via` says
which alt, when one did) is linked at intake, for the requesting admin, and starts `decision: skip`,
`status: already`; a series that is deleted (`deleted_at`) never counts as held, for any intake, so such a
title resolves and `/run` puts the same series back — whereas a title merged into another **is** held,
under its survivor's id (since v0.37.0): the row reads `already`, and the tracker link and floor land on
the series that holds the chapters, not on the absorbed row. Merging is transitive — a title absorbed two
merges ago is re-pointed at the final survivor in the same transaction as the second merge — so a backup or
tracker entry with that spelling still reads `already` rather than being re-added via another source (a
survivor hidden since is the deleted case above under another name). Its errors: **404**
`not_connected` (no enabled connection to that tracker), **422** `token_expired` (the connection's
`expires_at` has passed: the service is not called, the connection stays enabled, and `last_error` on it
reads `the access token has expired -- reconnect to resume syncing`, the sentence a push leaves), **422**
`tracker_rejected` (the service refused the saved token; the connection is disabled with the same sentence
a rejected push leaves — 422 rather than 401 because a 401 is retried after a session refresh and would
then read `not_connected`; the same code, without disabling, when the stored token cannot be unsealed),
**502** `tracker_unavailable` (no answer; nothing changed — a 400 or a 403 from the service never disables
anything: only a 401, or AniList's "Invalid token" 400, is a verdict on the token).
`GET .../batches/:id` polls `{batch, items}` — each item's `decision` is `unresolved | auto | manual | skip`
and, once the batch leaves `resolving`, an `unresolved` row means "no match found" rather than "not looked
at yet"; a tracker row reads `linked: true` when a `series_trackers` row carries its id (read live, not
remembered). A row's
`confidence` is `same_source` only when the backup entry's own Mihon source is installed here (a Suwayomi
extension) and a hit's extension-relative path equals the url the backup stored -- Mihon's identity for a
manga, which survives a retitle -- otherwise `exact | contains | fuzzy` from the title alone; a title with no
confident hit anywhere stays `unresolved`, and the first search result is never taken. `PATCH
/api/admin/import/candidates/:cid` accepts `{decision:'manual', source, sourceId, title, coverUrl?}` to
override a pick — this clears `matched_via`, since a hand-picked match was found by nobody's alternate —
`{decision:'skip'}`, or `{decision:'auto'}` to restore the resolve pass's own suggestion after an override
(`matched_via` is left as it is, so an auto → manual → auto detour loses the note); skipping the last open
row of a batch a run has been through closes the batch (`done`).
`POST .../batches/:id/run` takes `{candidateIds?, autoUpdate?}` — with `candidateIds` it adds only those
rows (a skipped or still-unresolved id is silently left out rather than erroring; an entry that is not a
uuid, or more than 500 of them, is **400** `bad_request`), omitted means every eligible row in the batch.
Each row's `status` afterwards is `added`, `already` (the library has the title — the same folder, or the
same title from another source under a spelling the up-front `in_library` check missed) or the add's error
code (`no_title`, `no_chapters`, `disabled`, `blocked`, `undownloadable`, `disk_full`, `bad_request`, `error`);
`already` counts under the batch's `already`, an error code under `failed`. A tracker row that ends `added`
or `already` is linked to its tracker entry (`series_trackers`, `linked_by` = **the account whose list was
read**, the batch's `user_id` — batches are shared between admins, and whoever calls `/run`, the link and
the floor are the owner's; the caller appears only in the `import.batch.run` audit row, whose `detail`
carries `owner`) and the owner's `tracker_progress` for it is set to the entry's `progress` with
`pushed_at` NULL — set, not raised: every read of the list replaces the floor with the tracker's current
number and clears the stamp, whatever this app had pushed before, so re-reading the list is how a downward
correction made on the tracker reaches this app. A push then goes out once the local count **exceeds** the
floor; equal to an unstamped floor is skipped quietly (the tracker already holds that number, and a push
would say `CURRENT` over a `COMPLETED` entry), equal to a stamped one — a number this app sent — still
pushes. A `progress` of 0 seeds nothing. Every add is
"nothing yet": the
series is created and followed, no chapter is downloaded, matching the bulk-select UI's promise that "Import
selected" only moves titles into the library. Safe to call again later on the same batch — a row already
imported is never re-added, which is how importing the matched rows now and the rest (found by hand
afterwards) later both work; the batch state reads `review`, not `done`, while anything importable is still
waiting; the flip to `importing` is one conditional UPDATE, so two simultaneous calls import once (the other
answers **409** `busy`). `DELETE .../batches/:id` discards a batch outright and stops a resolve or add loop
still running for it before its next row; no batch is ever written as `cancelled`. A batch left `resolving`
by a server restart reads back with `stale: true`; `POST .../batches/:id/resume` restarts matching for
whatever is still unresolved (the progress counter restarts from the rows already settled) and takes the
one-batch guard before looking the batch up, so a `/resume` and a `POST .../batches` at the same instant
start one loop (the other answers **409** `busy`). One left `importing` by a restart is handed back on the
next GET -- `review` with its unreached rows still ready, or `done` when every row had been processed; a
`review` batch a run has been through with nothing left waiting (every remaining row skipped) is closed to
`done` on GET as well, while one nothing was ever imported through (every title already owned) stays
`review`. `GET /api/admin/import/batches` lists every batch newest first (`{content: [{id, origin, tracker,
state, total, resolved, added, already, failed, skippedNovels, truncated, created_at, updated_at, stale}]}`,
no rows; `tracker` names the service a tracker batch was read from, null otherwise; `skippedNovels` (the
novels a tracker read dropped, 0 for the other origins) and `truncated` (the intake kept 500 of a longer
list, or the tracker read hit its cap) are the intake's own answer, kept on the row so a later view of the
batch — `GET .../batches/:id` carries them on `batch` too — still shows them; `stale` as on the single
GET, so the "Open imports" card can call an interrupted batch interrupted rather than matching); a batch is
swept seven days after it last changed once `done`, thirty days while still open. A batch or candidate id
that is not a uuid answers **404**. A gzipped backup that inflates past 256 MB (no real one does) is
**422** `parse_failed` like any unreadable file.

**Scanlation groups.** When a source lists the same chapter from more than one group (MangaDex does, and
so do extension sources that carry Mihon's scanlator column), the server keeps one file per number and the
choice is made by the release preferences: `{priority: [...], blocked: [...], patienceDays}`, group names
compared case-insensitively with spaces and punctuation ignored. The server-wide set is
`scanlator_prefs` on `GET /api/admin/settings`, written whole through `PATCH /api/admin/settings
{scanlatorPrefs}` (`priority` up to 50 names, `blocked` up to 200, `patienceDays` an integer 0–30 or
`null`; the default is nothing ranked, nothing blocked, two days). A series can carry its own through
`PATCH /api/admin/series/:id`, whose body is now `{autoUpdate?, scanlatorPrefs?, sourcePrefs?, borrowNames?, lang?, chapterFloor?, hideNotices?}` — at least one, no other
fields, each written on its own, and `scanlatorPrefs: null` clears the series' set. The two merge:
**blocked is the union**, a series **priority replaces** the global list, and a series `patienceDays` of
`null` **falls back** to the global one. A copy whose known groups are all blocked is dropped before the
choice is made — a joint release survives while any group on it is unblocked, a copy naming no group is
never blocked — so a number that only blocked groups have released is absent from the list altogether:
neither fetched nor counted as missing. A series only ever *waits* for a group when its effective priority
list is non-empty: with none, the best available copy is taken at once, so a series from a source that
names no groups is never held.

**Source order** (since v0.47.0, from #93). When a series follows more than one source, the copy of a number
it does not have yet is taken from the highest-ranked source that lists it. The order ranks **below** the
release preferences and the hosted-before-external rule, so it decides only between copies those call equal —
the choice the follow order used to make alone, where the primary won every tie. The server-wide order is
`source_prefs` on `GET /api/admin/settings`, `{priority: [...]}`, written whole through `PATCH
/api/admin/settings {sourcePrefs}`; a series can carry its own through `PATCH /api/admin/series/:id
{sourcePrefs}`, which **replaces** the server's for that series rather than merging, and `null` or an empty
`priority` clears it. Ids are kept as given — trimmed, de-duplicated, at most 100, anything outside letters,
digits and `_ . : -` dropped — whether or not that source is loaded right now, so an order saved while the
extension engine restarts keeps its extensions. A source the order does not name ranks below every one it
does, in the series' follow order. It never replaces a chapter already held.

`GET /api/admin/series/:id/scanlators` is what the series page's editor reads: `{checkedAt, prefs, global,
effective: {priority, blocked, patienceDays}, groups: [GroupStat & {listed}]}`, the groups gathered from the
live files on disk, from every copy in the listing the updater persisted at the last check (primary and
followed sources alike — never from the sources themselves on a page open, so `checkedAt` is how old the
figures are), and from the names already in the preferences (so a blocked group that has vanished from the
listing can still be unblocked — as a row of zeros), sorted by `onDisk + listed` and then by name. Each entry
carries exactly the figures `GET /api/series/:id/groups` answers (one aggregator over the same rows, so the
editor is the panel with buttons); `listed` is kept and equals `releases`.

`GET /api/admin/scanlators` is the library-wide version the Settings page's group picker reads:
`{content: [{name, onDisk, listed, series}]}`, every group this server knows of, busiest first — the names
gathered from the files on disk and from the persisted listings of every source (not from the sources
themselves; this is one call for the whole library), merged by the same group equality the release rules
use, `series` counting the series the group appears on. Memoised for 30 seconds.

**Deleting a chapter from the server, and fetching it again.** Both are admin actions on chosen chapters,
and both touch the download directory only: a chapter the scanner found in the read library is never
touched (`owned: false` on the Book), on the same footing as the read-chapter cleanup. Neither takes a
typed confirmation; the client confirms with the count.
`POST /api/admin/series/:id/chapters/delete {bookIds[]}` (1–500) deletes the files and keeps the rows as
tombstones, so reading history survives and the updater does not re-download them; the cover moves to the
lowest live chapter. A chapter somebody has a bookmark in is skipped (`bookmarked`), as the cleanup skips
it: a bookmark names a page inside the file. A chapter whose file *and* folder are missing is skipped
(`unlink_failed`) rather than marked — that is the download volume not being mounted, not a deleted
chapter. It answers `{ok, applied, bytes, skipped: [{id, reason}]}` with `reason` one of `not_found`,
`not_owned`, `already_pruned`, `bookmarked`, `outside_root`, `unlink_failed`, or **409** `refused` (with
`message` and `fix`) when the download directory is not writable.
`POST /api/admin/series/:id/chapters/refetch {bookIds?[], picks?[]}` (at least one, at most 300 combined)
downloads the chapters again as the copy the release rules choose *now* — after a change of priority, or a follow, that may be another group's —
onto the **same rows**, so progress stays attached. Only a row under the download folder (`not_owned`
otherwise — a read-library chapter is not Uchiyomi's to re-fetch, so a *Delete files* tombstone there has no
way back but a hand copy) at exactly the path the downloader writes (`Chapter <n>.cbz` in the series
folder; `not_ours` otherwise) is eligible, because only that path lands back on the same row. This is also
the only path back for a tombstoned chapter below a series' `chapter_floor`, which the sweep never wants
and *Fetch newest* takes only if it is the newest listed. The listing is refreshed first, as for `POST /api/sources/fetch`, so the copy is the
one the rules choose *now*, with the same `not_listed` / `blocked_group` / `source_unavailable` (including
a source the series no longer follows) / `cooldown` skips; the old file is set aside until
the new one lands and put back if the download fails, so a failed re-download never costs the chapter that
was there. A chapter the cleanup deleted is eligible: this is how it comes back. Answers
`{ok, started, folder, total, skipped}`, **409** `nothing_to_fetch` / `busy` / `refused` as above.
`picks: [{bookId, source, sourceId}]` replaces a row's file with *one named copy* out of the number's
versions instead of the rules' choice ("this chapter, but group B's version"): the row's number selects
the listing row, the pick selects the copy in it (`not_listed` when none matches), and as on
`POST /api/sources/fetch` a pick ignores the group rules including the blocklist — an explicit choice. A row
named in both lists is fetched as its pick, a second pick for the same row is skipped as `duplicate`; the
audit line carries `picks`.

**Removing a series, and what each step keeps.** `DELETE /api/admin/series/:id` hides: `deleted_at` is set,
the tracker link dropped, and every chapter row, file, progress row, favourite and rating stays; **400**
`already_deleted` for a hidden one, **400** `merged` for a series merged into another (a merge is one-way —
there is no un-merge, and the absorbed row can neither be hidden nor have its files deleted; see
`/merge`). `POST /api/admin/series/:id/restore` undoes it. `POST /api/admin/series/bulk/hide {ids: [...]}`
(since v0.37.0; 1 to 500 ids of 1–64 characters, duplicates once) is that same single delete once per id —
the Library page's *Remove from library* over a selection — and **only** that: it never touches files. It
answers `{ok: true, hidden, skipped: [{id, reason}]}` with `reason` one of `merged`, `already_hidden`,
`not_found`; an id that cannot be hidden is skipped with its reason and the rest still apply. One
`series.delete` audit row per hidden series, carrying `{id, title, books}`, exactly as the single route
writes it, nothing for skipped ids; **400** `bad_request` *Which series should be removed?* for a body that
is not `ids`. `GET /api/admin/series/deleted` lists the hidden ones, newest first, and since v0.37.0 each row
carries `live_books` and `pruned_books` (counted from the chapter rows; `books_count` is the scan's figure
and may be stale) — `live_books === 0 && pruned_books > 0` is how the panel knows the files are already gone.

`POST /api/admin/series/:id/delete-files {confirm}` — `confirm` is the series' title, compared through the
fold described under *Typing a title to confirm* below (**400** `confirm_mismatch` otherwise) — is the
irreversible step and only ever after the hide: it removes the series'
chapter files from every root it occupies (the read library included, which is why it takes the typed
title) and keeps every row. Since v0.37.0 each row whose file it actually removed is marked
pruned with `pruned_reason = 'deleted'` — the same tombstone `chapters/delete` and the cleanup leave — so a
restore afterwards lists those chapters as `pruned` (*Deleted from the server*, where `chapters/refetch`
brings one back onto the same row — for the rows under the download folder; a read-library row is
`not_owned` there and its file is the admin's to put back) instead of as openable chapters that 404, the updater's have-set keeps
counting them as held, and `files` in the answer `{ok, files, bytes}` counts real unlinks, not rows (a
second call reports 0). A row whose file is already absent is reconciled only when the root is provably
mounted — `stat(root)` works, at least one chapter file of any series is present under it (a present folder
is not proof: the downloader `mkdir -p`s series folders on a bare mount point), and no more than 90 % of
what was looked at is absent, the verify task's own rule; up to 200 other series' live rows on the root are
stat'ed when none of this series' own is present. Under that proof a live row with no file is marked
`pruned_reason = 'deleted'` and a `'missing'` tombstone becomes `'deleted'`; on an unproven root every row
is left as it was, so an unmounted share leaves live rows, which Forget refuses on. `files` still counts
unlinks only, so a series whose folder was removed by hand answers `files: 0` and its Removed row then
offers Forget (`live_books` 0). Delete files on a merge survivor also removes the folders of the rows
merged into it, and every folder is resolved on every root before anything is unlinked. It refuses,
**409** `refused` `{message, fix}`, rather than half-applying: the series is not hidden yet, it has no
chapter rows on any root (*That series has no files on disk.*), a folder resolves outside the library, or a
root is not writable (`PUID`/`PGID` unset; `fix` names it). Nothing here deletes a series row or a chapter
row: `read_progress.book_id` is `ON DELETE RESTRICT` on purpose. The one route that does is the third step
below.

**Forget: Remove → Delete files → Forget.** `POST /api/admin/series/:id/forget {confirm}` (since v0.38.0;
`confirm` is the series' title, compared through the same fold — **400** `confirm_mismatch`
*Type the series title to confirm — typography does not have to match.* otherwise, **400** `bad_request` without a
body) is the only call that hard-deletes a
series row. It erases every member's progress, reading events, bookmarks, notes, ratings, favourites, tracker
floors and collection entries on it, so stats, streaks, the leaderboard and Wrapped change retroactively, and
answers `{ok: true, books, absorbed, users}` — chapter rows erased, series rows that had been merged into
this one and went with it, and distinct members who lose history: progress, reading events, bookmarks,
notes, favourites, ratings, collection entries, or a tracker floor that is erased rather than carried to a
merge survivor (opening the series page, the NEW-badge counter, does not count). Rows the series absorbed
by merge are forgotten with it in the same transaction (leaving them would flip them live: `merged_into` is `ON DELETE
SET NULL`). History on chapters that moved to a merge survivor is kept under the survivor: every per-user
table is re-pointed to the chapter's current series first, deletes are keyed on the chapter ids this series
actually owns, and if a progress row or bookmark on another series' chapter is still filed here after that
the whole transaction rolls back — **409** `refused` `stranded`, nothing changed. It refuses, **409**
`refused` `{message, fix}`, in exactly four other cases: `live`, while the series is still in the library
(*Remove the series first. Forgetting it is a third, separate step.*, fix *Content → Library → Remove, then
Delete files, then Forget.*); `live_books`, while any chapter row still claims a file (*N chapter row(s)
still claim(s) a file on disk. Delete the files first, or the next scan brings the series back under a new
id with none of its history.*, fix *Delete files, then Forget.*); `missing_files`, only for a root that
cannot be stat'ed (*<root> is not there right now, so nothing can be checked against it.*, fix *Mount the
library and delete the files first.*); and `folder_present`, while the folder still holds chapters under
any root (*The folder "…" still holds chapters under <root>. Forgetting the series now would only have the
next scan bring it back under a new id, with none of its history.*, fix *Delete files first, or remove the
folder by hand and rescan.* — an empty folder does not refuse, since the scanner never turns one into a
series). A `'missing'` tombstone from the verify task does not refuse: nothing in Uchiyomi marks a chapter
row whose file it cannot see — verify refuses a root with no present file, and Delete files reconciles only
under the same proof — so an unmounted share leaves every row live and the `live_books` refusal is what
stops it, whereas a `'missing'` mark means verify proved the root was mounted and the file was not on it.
There is no Put back. Audit row
`series.forget {id, title, folder, books, absorbed, absorbedIds, users, rowsByTable}`. Since the same
release, a merge also carries **bookmarks** to the survivor (they used to keep the absorbed id) and the
tracker floor keeps the higher of the two counts, so a merge made now never leaves history for Forget to
strand.

**Typing a title to confirm (since v0.42.0).** `delete-files` and `forget` both take the series' title in
`confirm`, and since v0.42.0 the two sides are compared through one fold rather than byte for byte. In
order: a bounded set of HTML entities is decoded once (`&amp;`, `&#39;`, `&#x2019;` — one layer only, so
`&amp;quot;` stays `&quot;`); the string is NFKC-normalised; curly quotes, apostrophes and primes fold to
`'` and `"`, and U+2010–U+2015 and U+2212 to `-`; zero-width characters, variation selectors and emoji are
dropped; every kind of Unicode space becomes one ASCII space, runs collapse and the ends are trimmed.
**Case is not folded** — it is visible, and the same dialog in the app confirms deleting a member — and a
title that folds to nothing (emoji only) is confirmed by the exact string instead. The client applies the
identical function (`web/lib/confirmTitle.ts` and `bff/src/lib/confirmTitle.ts` are byte-identical, and a
test holds them so), because loosening only the button would have traded a dead control for a 400. On one
real library 38 of 241 titles carried a curly apostrophe, a dash, an entity or a non-breaking space and so
could not be confirmed from a keyboard at all.

**Verify chapter files.** `POST /api/admin/tasks/verify/run` (since v0.37.0; the Tasks panel's *Verify
chapter files*) is the repair for a database restored without its chapter files. It is **detached**, like
`update` and `cleanup`: one stat per row over a network share is minutes on a large library, and a request
held open that long dies at the reverse proxy while the walk keeps going. It answers **200** `{ok: true,
started: true}` at once, or `{ok: false, error: 'busy'}` while a walk is already going; the counts are not in
the answer — they land on `GET /api/admin/tasks` (the panel polls every 5 s) as the `verify` entry's
`lastResult`, and in the audit row `library.verify {checked, missing, readLibraryMissing, unmounted, ms}`
written when the walk ends, beside the usual `task.run {task: 'verify'}` at the press. Per root it stats
every un-pruned row (both roots are walked and counted), but **only rows under the download folder**
(`/library-dl`) are marked, as pruned with `pruned_reason = 'missing'` (rows never deleted; the cover moves to
the lowest live chapter): a re-fetch lands there on the same row, whereas a read-library (`/library`) row
marked missing would be "fetched again" into a different row, the tombstone would never clear and the
number would be listed twice. A read-library row whose file is gone is counted in `readLibraryMissing` and
never marked — those files are the engine's or the admin's to put back. Per root, the **whole-batch rule**
from the read-chapter cleanup decides what a missing root means: a root where no checked row's *file* is
present — an empty folder is not proof of a mount, the downloader creates folders while a share is down —
or that cannot be read at all, is a volume that is not mounted (or an empty disk, which looks identical
from inside the container), so it marks nothing and is reported in `unmounted` as its bare path; and by
the **90 % rule** a root where more than nine rows in ten have no file is refused the same way, reported as
`"<root> (95 % of 20 chapter files missing)"`, so one stray download on a bare mount cannot turn "unmounted"
into "mark everything else" (exactly 90 % is still marked). `'missing'` is the one `pruned_reason` the
updater does **not** count as held (`pruned_at IS NULL OR pruned_reason IS DISTINCT FROM 'missing'`; NULL
is the cleanup and anything marked before v0.37.0, `'deleted'` is *Delete files*), so the next sweep — and
Fetch newest — download those chapters again onto the same rows and the scan clears the mark; a row below a
series' `chapter_floor` is outside the sweep's want-list and comes back through `chapters/refetch` only. A
row the cleanup already marked keeps its reason. It never runs at boot or on a schedule. `GET /api/admin/tasks`
always lists it: `{id: 'verify', name: 'Verify chapter files', schedule: 'on demand · after a database-only
restore', lastRun: number | null, lastResult: {ok: true, checked, missing, readLibraryMissing, unmounted:
string[], roots, ms, stopped?: 'shutdown'} | null, running}` — `checked` is rows whose file was looked for
under roots that were not skipped (both roots), `missing` the download-root rows marked this run. `lastRun`
and `lastResult` are persisted in `server_settings.verify_last_run` / `verify_last_result`, so a restart does
not turn the last run into "not run yet"; a run that threw stores a NULL result, so no stale healthy line
comes back. A shutdown stops it between batches; what it had marked stays marked, because it was true.

**Repair the library.** `POST /api/admin/tasks/repair/run` (since v0.41.0; the Tasks panel's *Repair
library*, and the *Fix* / *Fill now* / *Retry now* keys and the *Reset the solver* action on the Health tab —
*It's fine* is the separate `confirm-short` route below) runs the nightly repair now. It is **detached**, like `update` and `verify`, and answers **200**
`{ok: true, started: true}` (since v0.49.0 with the run's id, below); a full run's counts land on `GET
/api/admin/tasks` as the `repair` entry's `lastResult`.
It is the only task that takes a **body**: `{only?: ('solver' | 'count' | 'failures' | 'short' | 'gaps' |
'groups' | 'names' | 'directions')[], seriesId?, bookId?, sourceId?, now?}`. With no body it runs all eight steps over
the whole library, in that order. `directions` (since v0.48.0) asks MangaDex (the original language of every
series that follows it) and AniList (the country of origin of every linked series) about the series whose
reading direction nothing has said yet — at most `REPAIR_DIRECTIONS_MAX` (500) series per service a night, 100
ids per MangaDex request and 50 per AniList request — and reports `directions: {asked, learned}`.
`groups` (since v0.47.0) does nothing unless group upgrades are switched on —
`groupUpgrade` on `PATCH /api/admin/settings`, `group_upgrade` on its GET, off by default — and each swap it
makes is audited as `book.group_upgraded`. `names` (also v0.47.0) borrows chapter names from another source
and likewise does nothing unless `borrowNames` is on for the server or for a series (`borrow_names` on the
settings GET, `borrowNames` on `PATCH /api/admin/series/:id`, where `null` follows the server); it writes
`lib_books.chapter_name` only, marked with the donor in `chapter_name_source`, and switching it off clears
exactly those.
Each target belongs to exactly one step — `seriesId` to `gaps` (that series, ignoring the 24-hour re-check
cooldown), `bookId` to `short` (that chapter), `sourceId` to `failures` (that source's failed chapters,
whatever their age) — and a target sent **without** `only: ["<its step>"]` is a **400** `bad_request` with a
message naming the step, rather than a full nightly run carrying an argument four steps ignore. `only` takes
each step at most once. `now: true` is for the whole library only, and only where the `failures` step runs (a
**400** otherwise): that step then resets every source's failed chapters whatever their age and re-checks up to
10 series from the sources that can be asked now. Health's *Fix all issues* sends it, and since v0.49.0 so does
the *Fix all* on its *Chapters that would not download* card.

Two refusals, deliberately different: `{ok: false, error: 'sweep_running'}` while a chapter sweep is
running, and `{ok: false, error: 'busy'}` while another repair is. The two jobs never overlap in either
direction — both download into the same series folders and both write `lib_books` for what landed — so each
tick waits ten minutes for the other, and `runSweep` itself refuses while a repair holds the folders. The
refusal is symmetrical in the answer too: `POST /api/admin/tasks/update/run` answers `{ok: false, error:
'repair_running'}` while a library repair is running, for the same reason and in the same words as the
repair's `sweep_running` — a shared `busy` would tell the admin that the task they just pressed is the one
that is stuck. The `repair_enabled` switch gates the **schedule only**: a run somebody asked for always
starts, because nothing the repair does is destructive; the nightly honours the switch and reports
`skipped: 'disabled'`.

`GET /api/admin/tasks` always lists it: `{id: 'repair', name: 'Repair library', schedule: 'every 24h · never
during a chapter sweep'` (or `'switched off · on demand'`), `lastRun: number | null, lastResult, running}`,
persisted in `server_settings.repair_last_run` / `repair_last_result` so a restart keeps the last run; a run
that threw stores a NULL result rather than leaving an older healthy line. The result is `{ok: true, ms,
only?, counted, uncounted, short: {looked, replaced, confirmed, left}, gaps: {series, followed, fetched,
unfillable, sweep}, failures: {reset, retried?: {series, added, failed}}, solver: {reset, unblocked,
expired}, skipped?: 'disabled', stopped?: 'shutdown' | 'disk'}`. Audit: `task.run {task: 'repair'}` at the
press and `library.repair {only?, seriesId?, bookId?, sourceId?, summary, stopped?, replaced[], confirmed[],
followed[]}` when the run ends (`user_id` NULL for the nightly), plus `book.short_fixed` for each chapter
replaced and the existing `series.follow_source` for each source followed.

**Since v0.49.0 every run is kept, and only a full run is the Tasks line.** The answer is `{ok: true, started:
true, run}`, `run` being the run's id (a uuid). Every run — the nightly and every Health press — is a row in
`repair_runs` (pruned to at least the newest 50 and everything from the last 90 days), but only a **full** run (no
`only`: the nightly, or Tasks → Run now) writes `server_settings.repair_last_run` / `repair_last_result`, so `GET
/api/admin/tasks`' `lastRun`/`lastResult` stay the nightly's when someone presses *Fix* on one chapter, and the
nightly's schedule (armed after a restart from `repair_last_run`) no longer moves either. The `repair` entry adds
`lastOrigin` (`'nightly' | 'manual' | null` — who started the run the line shows, `null` while the run history has
not caught up with it), `startedAt`, `run` (the running run's id), `nextAt` (when the nightly is armed for) and
`latestOther` (the newest scoped run). Every task entry carries `scheduleKey` (the schedule sentence with
`{placeholders}`, a locale key on the web) and `scheduleVars`; `schedule` stays the English sentence. The result
may carry `stepMs` and `skips: [{step, target?, why, until?, detail?}]` — `folder_busy`, `not_eligible` (with
`detail`: `gone`, `confirmed`, `partial`, `not_owned`, `not_short`), `no_gaps`, `source_cooling_down` (with
`until`), `source_off`, `solver_down`, `no_searches_left` — so a press that did nothing says why. Fill now
(`seriesId`) looks at the series even while its automatic updates are off, and fetches the gap chapters a source it
already follows lists (at most 20) instead of leaving them to a sweep.

`GET /api/admin/tasks/repair/status` is the run, live, for the Health page (polled every 2 s while a run is going;
memory and a memoised history digest only): `{running, sweepRunning, enabled, nextAt, run, last, recent, lastFull,
limits, estimates, stepTypicalMs}`. `run` is `null` or `{id, startedAt, origin, mine, kind, only, target, steps,
step, stepIndex, stepStartedAt, stepMs, planned, current {kind, seriesId?, bookId?, title?, number?, sourceId?,
phase, done?, of?}, counts, budget {left, of}, shortReserve, skips, cancelRequested}` — who started it is never
sent, and a series title is dropped for a viewer who may not list that series. `last` is the newest finished run of
any kind: a page that pressed a fix watches for ITS id there. `limits` is every bound the process runs with (env
overrides applied); `estimates` maps a run kind (`full`, `fix_short`, `fill`, `retry`, `steps:<a+b…>[:now]`, plus
up to ten named in `?kinds=`) to `{typicalMs, runs, worstMs, downloads}` — `typicalMs` the median of its last five
finished runs, `worstMs` the sum of the waits the code bounds (null when a planned step has no such bound), and
downloads a count, never folded into the time. `lastFull` is the newest full run that finished, a nightly the
switch turned away (`skipped`) included and one a restart cut off (`interrupted`) not. `GET
/api/admin/tasks/repair/runs?limit=1..50&id=` lists the kept runs, newest first: `{content: [{id, startedAt,
finishedAt, origin, username, mine, kind, only, target, status, ms, stepMs, result, notes}]}`. `notes` (`{replaced,
confirmed, followed, upgraded}`) names series by title alone, with no id to hold each one to the 18+ hide, so it
is `null` unless the request carries `?adult=1`; a title in `target` or a skip is dropped for a viewer who may not
list that series. Both are admin-only.

What one run may cost is bounded by `REPAIR_HOURS`, `REPAIR_COUNT_MAX`, `REPAIR_SHORT_MAX` and
`REPAIR_GAPS_MAX` (plus `REPAIR_PACE_MS`); their defaults and ranges, and the bounds that are fixed rather
than configurable, are in [CONFIGURATION](CONFIGURATION.md#the-nightly-repair).

**Confirm a short chapter.** `POST /api/admin/books/:id/confirm-short {confirmed?: boolean = true}` records
that a one- or two-page chapter really is that short at the source: it sets `lib_books.short_confirmed_at`,
which greys the row on the Health page (listed with `fixed`) and stops the repair investigating it.
`{confirmed: false}` withdraws it and the chapter is an open finding again. **404** for a chapter that is not
there; audit `book.short_confirmed {id, seriesId, title, number, pages, confirmed}`. The nightly writes the
same stamp itself, but only with proof — one copy from each of up to three sources the series follows, every
one of them answering two pages or fewer, with none silent, in a cooldown, left unasked by that cap or
answering with an empty page list (an empty page list is a parse failure, not a zero-page chapter), and a
search that found no other source — and the stamp is cleared automatically whenever the file changes
underneath it, because the proof was about bytes that are no longer there.

**Following a second source.** `POST /api/admin/series/:id/sources {planId, source, sourceSeriesId}` makes
the updater merge that source's chapter list with the primary's on every check; it answers `{ok, sources}`
with the series' full source list, primary first. The candidate must come from a `POST /api/sources/fill/scan`
plan for this series and the plan must have found it followable — at least 90% of the chapter numbers
already held listed there, with a verdict of `ok` or `nothing_to_fill`. There are two ways into a follow —
this route, and `alsoFollow` on `POST /api/sources/add`, both admin-only — and both make the "same series?"
judgement on the server, starting from that rule (`followable()` in `lib/fill.ts`): here from a plan, with
the admin looking at each candidate; there from the add's own listing plus the candidate's title, and the
numbering both ways unless the title is exact on a listing of at least ten (`lib/autoFollow.ts`, described
under the add route). Neither takes a bare pair on trust, which would let a client follow anything it
could name. Refusals: **409** `plan_stale` (scan again), `is_primary`, `source_unavailable` (adapter not
loaded or disabled), and since v0.52.0 (#123) `language_differs` -- the source is in another language than the
series; the scan never offers one, so only a plan from before the series' language changed meets it. Its `message`
and `messageSaid` (`follow.languageDiffers`, `{theirs, ours}` as language codes) name both, and `edition: {of, lang}`
is the add route's edition to add instead -- or, when the work already holds an edition that may follow the source,
`edition` also carries `existing: {id, lang}` (that edition's series id and language) and the sentence is
`follow.languageDiffersEdition` (`{theirs, ours, edition}`): follow it on that edition instead; **400** `not_in_plan`, `not_followable` (with `reason` and `coverage`), or
`bad_request` when the plan belongs to another series; **404** for an unknown series. Following the same source again updates its
series id and coverage, and makes a follower the add-time path chose the confirming admin's (`auto:
false`). `DELETE /api/admin/series/:id/sources/:sourceId` stops following it (**404** when
the series was not) and answers the remaining list; chapters already downloaded from it stay, but the
listing rows it carried go at once, so its ghosts leave the series page and nothing can be fetched through
it before the next check.

With a follower in place, the updater takes each missing number from whichever followed source offers the
best copy — a ranked group first, then a hosted copy over an external link, then the primary over the
followers in the order they were added, then the earliest release — and a series whose primary is in a
cooldown still updates from a follower that answers; it is `blocked` only when every followed source is.
`GET /api/admin/series/:id/check` now reports `waiting` alongside `added`: the number of missing chapters
held back for a ranked group (omitted when none). The `frozen-series` health check lists a series whose
primary is gone but which still follows a live source as information rather than a warning.

**Other names** (since v0.49.1; the idea and the parsing are @TIGamingTV's, PR #119). A series keeps the other
names it goes by: `GET /api/admin/series/:id/alt-titles` answers `{titles: [{title, norm, origin, addedBy,
createdAt}]}`, an admin's names first. `origin` is `admin` (typed here), `import` (a tracker's synonyms, kept
when an import added the series) or `description` (read from the series' main source's own description --
"Alternative Titles:"-style lines at the start of a line, Latin script only, each key at least five characters,
at most twenty -- when the series is added and whenever that source's details are read again). `addedBy` is a
username (null for a name the server read). `POST {title}` adds one and answers the list: **400** `non_latin` or
`too_short` (a key under five letters or digits), **409** `exists` (the same key, or the series' own title).
`DELETE .../alt-titles/:norm` removes one by its key and answers the list; it is idempotent. A removed name stays
removed, whatever its origin -- out of every list and search, and not brought back by a later read of the source's
description or by an import -- until an admin types it again with `POST`, which makes it theirs. A merge carries
the names to the survivor, and
Forget erases them. Every search for another source asks under the title and up to three of these -- Find other
sources below, the add's `alsoFollow` judgement, the nightly source hunt, borrowed chapter names and Find
missing chapters (`POST /api/sources/fill/scan`, before the typed `altTitle`) -- and an other name matches
**exactly**, never by containment, and is then measured by the numbering both ways: a sequel's page may list its
parent's name.

**Find other sources** (since v0.49.1). `POST /api/admin/sources/find {seriesIds}` (up to 500, in the order
given) or `{sourceId}` (every series whose **main** source that is -- the "this site is down" case) starts one
background run and answers **202** `{runId, total}`; **409** `{error: 'busy', runId}` while another is going,
**400** `empty_scope` when nothing named is a series this admin may see (or `bad_request`). Per series it skips a
series numbered by posting order (`why: posting_order`) or already following two sources (`full`); otherwise it
searches the sources the starting admin may reach (their own age cap, as Discover and the manual follow route read
it: an admin reaches every source, including extensions flagged adult) in scan order -- never its main source,
never one it follows, never one disabled or cooling down -- under its title and up to three other names (a series
with none stored is first given the ones its stored description, or else its main source's, lists), stops once the free follower slots are filled or three sources carried the title, judges each candidate as
the add's auto-follow does, and follows the ones that qualify with the admin as their author. It waits while a
sweep, a repair or the daily source check runs, paces 1.5 s between series that searched, gives a series 90 s, and
its searches report nothing to source health (a site that fails one is neither put in a cooldown nor marked
failing). `GET /api/admin/sources/find` answers `{running, run, recent}`: `run` is the running run or else the
newest, `{id, status: running|done|stopped|failed|interrupted, total, done, followed, startedBy (a username),
startedAt, finishedAt?, sourceId?, sourceName?, current?: {seriesId, title}, waiting?: sweep|repair|check,
results: [{seriesId, title?, followed: [{sourceId, name, chapters}], why?}]}`, and `recent` the newest 20 runs
without `results` or `current`. Since v0.52.0 `?runId=` reads that kept run in full as `run` instead, an earlier
search reopened (a review-first run's matches can still be decided there), or **404** `not_found` when no kept run
has that id. `done` counts the series searched through: a series a stop cut short with nothing to show is listed
as `not_tried` and, since v0.52.0, not counted (runs kept from before count it). `why` is set when nothing was followed, and says exactly what happened. Decided
without a search: `posting_order`, `full` (two sources followed already), `too_few` (fewer than three chapter
numbers, which nothing can be measured against) and `no_source` (no other source to ask: all turned off, cooling
down or excluded). After one: `refused` (a candidate failed the title and chapter-number check), `no_answer`
(nothing answered, or the source that carried it did not answer for its chapters), `followed_already` (nothing
new, for a series that already follows another source -- which lists it) and `no_match` (nothing, and the series
follows no other source). `not_tried` is what a stop, the series' 90 s wall or a restart cut short -- never "not
found". A run that ends stopped or `interrupted` lists every series it never reached as `not_tried`: a shutdown
gives the run a few seconds to close its own row, and a row still running after a restart is closed at boot the
same way, from the series ids its scope resolved to when it started. A series the viewer may not list keeps its
entry without `title`.
`POST /api/admin/sources/find/stop` stops the run at once (`{stopped}`; false when none was going). When a run
ends, every series that gained a source gets a listing refresh, 1.5 s apart (nothing is downloaded: the sweep
takes the new chapters from there), the Health summary is refreshed, and `source.find` is audited with the scope
and the counts (each follow as `series.follow_source` with `via: find_sources`). While it runs, `GET
/api/sources/jobs` carries its card to admins: `kind: find_sources`, `done`/`total` in series, `followed`,
`current` (hidden like any run's), `downloads: false`, and `waiting` (`sweep`, `repair` or `check`, as the run's
own `waiting`) while it waits for one of those. On Health, a failing (or turned-off) source that is some
series' main source carries the action `find_sources` with `findSeries`, and so does a "Series that can no longer
update" row whose reason is its source.

**Review first** (since v0.51.0, #132; @TIGamingTV's idea from PR #133). `POST /api/admin/sources/find` with
`review: true` runs the same search and the same judgement, follows nothing, and keeps what it found: the run
reads `review: true`, and a series with candidates carries `proposals` (and no `why`) -- the best candidate per
source, in scan order, `{sourceId, sourceName, sourceSeriesId, url?, title, coverUrl?, chapters, ours: {lined, of},
theirs: {lined, of}, coverage, verdict, amber?, state?}`. `coverUrl` is the source's own (show it through `GET
/img/sources/cover`); `ours` is how many of the series' chapter numbers it lists, `theirs` how many of its numbers
the series lists. `verdict: green` is what an automatic run would follow; `amber` is for a person to look at --
`amber: numbering` (a name matches exactly, the numbers do not line up) or `other_name` (it lines up, but matched
only under another name of the series). A title that merely contains the series' with numbers that do not line up
(a sequel's shape) is never proposed. `POST /api/admin/sources/find/:runId/follow {seriesId, sourceId}` follows one:
checked again (the series visible and not numbered by posting order; the source loaded, switched on, not its main
source, reachable for the series' rating, and not followed already -- never re-pointed), then written under the
follower cap with the admin as its author, its listing refreshed, and audited as `series.follow_source` with `via:
find_review`; it answers `{result}`, the series' result as it now reads, or **404** `not_found`, **409** `decided`
(with `state`), `posting_order`, `source_unavailable`, `language_differs` (since v0.52.0: the source is in another
language than the series, with `edition: {of, lang}`, the add route's edition to add instead, and `existing: {id,
lang}` in it when the work already holds an edition that may follow the source, as the manual follow answers it),
`already_followed` or `full`. `POST
/api/admin/sources/find/:runId/dismiss {seriesId, sourceId}` dismisses one for good. `state` is `followed` or
`dismissed`. A series the viewer may not list keeps its proposals without `title`, `coverUrl` and `url`.

### Admin — extensions (Mihon / Tachiyomi)

Present only when an extension engine is configured; see [extensions.md](extensions.md).

Installed extensions are kept current by a scheduled task, `extensions`, which appears in
`GET /api/admin/tasks` and can be started with `POST /api/admin/tasks/extensions/run` (answers
`{ ok: false, error: 'busy' }` while one is running, `not_configured` when there is no engine). Its interval
and kill switch are `extensionHours` and `extensionAutoUpdate` on `PATCH /api/admin/settings`, whose
response also carries `extensions_configured` -- not a column, and the only field that says whether there is
an engine at all (`extension_hours` has a default, so it is set on every install either way).

Its stored result -- `extension_last_result`, returned as the task's `lastResult` -- carries `refreshed`
(false when the repositories could not be read, with `refreshError`), `updated`, `failed`, `obsolete`,
`updatesAvailable`, `newUpstream`, `removedUpstream`, `reposRestored`, `reinstalled`, `removedOutside` and
`deferred`. A check that could not refresh reports nothing else: it deliberately does not fall back to the
stale catalogue.

`POST /api/admin/extensions/update-all` re-reads the repositories first and then applies everything, which is
the same work the scheduled check does with `forceUpdate`. It answers **409** while a check is running.

`POST /api/admin/extensions/repos` takes `{ url }` -- what a person pasted, at most 2,000 characters. Since
v0.45.0 the server decides what that means: it trims it, unwraps an *Add to Mihon* link
(`mihon://add-repo?url=…`, `tachiyomi://add-repo?url=…`, or a web `…/add-repo?url=…`), adds `https://` when there
is no scheme, and turns a GitHub `…/blob/<branch>/…` file link into the raw file (a branch is never guessed).
A repository is kept only when it brought extensions, counted from the engine's per-extension `repo` field:
**200** `{ ok, url, corrected, added, total, error? }`, where `added` is what THIS repository contributed and
`total` the whole catalogue; `corrected` is true when the alternative address (`index.json` → the
`index.min.json` beside it, or a folder → `<folder>/index.min.json`; the pinned engine reads a list-shaped index
only at an address ending in `/index.min.json`) is the one that worked. Refusals carry a stable `error`:
**400** `bad_url` or `github_page` (a repository page, not its index), **409** `exists` (the same repository
compared without case, scheme, trailing slash or index file name; nothing is written), **422** `empty` (it
yielded nothing and was removed again, with `reason` when the engine's refresh reported one -- v2.3.2243 logs
a missing or unreadable repository without reporting it, so `reason` is usually absent -- and `removed: false`
if the removal failed),
**502** `unreachable` (the engine's list could not be read; nothing was written) or `engine_refused` (the
engine refused the write, with `reason`; the previous list is put back). `DELETE` with `{ url }` removes every
spelling of that repository and answers `{ ok, removed }`; both keep the scheduled check's own copy of the list
in step, so a removed repository is not restored by the next check.

`POST /api/admin/extensions/sources/bulk` takes `{ ids?, langs?, enabled }` (at least one selector) and
switches every matching source in one statement and one registry reload, answering `changed` (rows that
actually flipped), `hiddenLangs`, `registered` and `skipped`. `langs` also records the standing preference:
a hidden language stays off when the next extension is installed, until it is shown again. `ids` do not --
turning one source back on by hand is an exception to the preference, not a change of it. A row whose
language is null is reachable only by id. `GET /api/admin/extensions/sources` carries the per-language
overview as `langs` (sources, enabled, series that came from them, hidden), unaffected by its `q`/`lang`
filters, and `GET /api/admin/extensions/status` reports `registered`, `skipped` and `cap` so the
`SUWAYOMI_MAX_SOURCES` overflow is visible rather than a line in the boot log.

`GET /api/admin/extensions/status` is also what Admin → Extensions' setup screen reads (v0.49.0, #72). With no
engine to talk to it answers `{ configured: false, reachable: false, off, platform, linkedSeries }`: `off` is
`switch` (`EXTENSION_ENGINE=0` while `SUWAYOMI_URL` names the bundled container) or `unset` (no address),
`platform` is the install the steps open on (`desktop`, `compose`, `unraid`, `casaos`, `umbrel` or `unknown`,
from `UCHIYOMI_PLATFORM`, Unraid's `HOST_OS` and the compose files' `EXTENSION_ENGINE`), and `linkedSeries`
counts the series added through an extension. With one it adds `engine` (host and port), `platform`, `retry`
(`{ attempts, since, nextAt }` while the registration retry runs: every 5 minutes after the first few, until
the engine answers; otherwise `null`), `lastTry` and `lastTryOk` (the last attempt to reach the engine, whoever
made it -- this call's own look included -- and whether it answered; v0.49.1), `linkedSeries` and, when the engine
answers, `solver` (`{ supported, enabled, wiring, connectable, url }`, `wiring` one of `ok`, `off`, `localhost`,
`other`, `unsupported`; `url` is never sent on desktop, where it carries the in-app helper's token). When the engine
answers but the last registration missed it, the call registers its sources before replying, which is what
makes the setup screen's **Check again** a plain refetch. `POST /api/admin/extensions/solver` points the
engine's own Cloudflare helper at the solver Uchiyomi uses (`FLARESOLVERR_URL`) and switches it on -- only when
asked, never by itself -- answering `{ ok, enabled, wiring }`, or **400** `not_configured` / `no_solver` (Uchiyomi
has no `FLARESOLVERR_URL` to share) / `unsupported`, or **502** `unreachable`; it is audited as
`extension.solver` with the solver's host only.

**An extension's own settings (v0.49.0, #116).** `GET /api/admin/extensions/sources/:id/preferences` reads the
preference screen Mihon shows for one extension source, through the engine: `{ source { id, name, lang, pkgName,
extensionName }, siblings, preferences, usedBy, renumbers }`. Each preference is `{ key, type (switch, checkbox,
list, multiselect, text), title, summary, visible, enabled, value, default, entries?, entryValues?, dialogTitle?,
dialogMessage?, numbering }`, in screen order; `numbering` marks a setting that changes the chapter numbers the
source gives (the Webtoons extension's *Use sequential chapter numbering*). `siblings` are the extension's other
sources, one per language, and `GET /api/admin/extensions/sources?pkg=<pkgName>` lists the same from an
extension's package name (every row there carries `pkgName` now). `POST` with `{ key, value }` changes one
setting, **addressed by key**: the engine addresses a write by its position on the screen, which an extension
update can move, so the server reads the screen again, finds the key's current position and checks the value
against the setting's type and choices before sending it. It answers `{ ok, changed, applied, remap, preferences,
usedBy, renumbers }`; **400** `unknown_pref`, `ambiguous_pref`, `disabled` or `bad_value`, **404**
`unknown_source`, **502** `unreachable` (the engine did not answer) or `extension_error` (it answered with the
extension's own exception, whose first line is in `message`). Since v0.49.1 every refusal also carries
`messageSaid` (a `pref.*` code, with the setting's title and the refused value, or the exception's line, as
parameters). A changed numbering setting marks every series from
the source that uses its numbers (not those numbered by posting order) with `numbering_pending = 'remap'` -- `remap`
is how many -- and each then waits for an admin to confirm its renaming below. A text setting is audited by its
length only:
extensions keep logins and keys in them.

**Chapter numbering (v0.49.0, #116).** A source that gives many different posts one chapter number (Webtoons:
Istrevelia's 226 posts on 13 numbers) is numbered by posting order, 1..K. `GET /api/sources/detail` answers
`numbering` { verdict (strong, hint, none), applied, ordered, posts, numbers, biggest, examples, alt { count,
first, last }, extSourceId? } with `count`/`first`/`last` following `applied`; `POST /api/sources/add` takes
`numbering: 'auto' | 'source' | 'posting_order'` (default `auto`); `GET /api/series/:id/listing` answers
`numbering` { mode, by, pending, note, changedAt, sourceName, extSourceId? } to every viewer of the series; each
copy in `GET /api/series/:id/versions` carries its own `title`. A series already in a library is never renamed
unattended: `GET /api/admin/series/:id/numbering?mode=posting_order|source|remap` answers the plan -- every
file's move with how its post was matched, the books no post matched (`parked`), shared numbers
(`collisions`), `clean` with its `reasons`, and `tracker` -- changing nothing (**502** `unreachable` when the source
does not answer), and `POST /api/admin/series/:id/numbering` with
`{ mode: 'auto' | 'source' | 'posting_order' | 'remap', confirm? }`
answers `needs_confirm` with that plan until `confirm: true`, then `applied` (files renamed in place; book ids,
progress, bookmarks and notes kept), `pending` (not applied yet; the series stays held: the source did not answer,
or the apply was refused, with `error` saying why -- a file already at a target name, or another check inside the
series -- and `plan.reasons` carrying `busy` when a download started meanwhile) or `unchanged` (the numbering it
already has: *Keep the source's numbers* renames nothing). With `confirm`, **409** `busy` while chapters are being
fetched into the folder or a check is inside the series -- the sweep, Check now, a listing refresh, Fill -- which
would fetch into the old numbers after the renames; `message` says which, and since v0.49.1 `messageSaid` too
(`renumber.downloading` or `renumber.checking`), as a refused apply's `error` comes with `errorSaid`
(`renumber.onDisk` or `renumber.leavesRoot` with the `file`). A manual choice is never undone by the
detector. A confirmed apply that runs past a minute answers `pending` with `running: true` and carries on; the
series' `numbering` says when it is done.

Automatic numbering needs a STRONG verdict — at least 12 posts, at least half of them beyond the first on their
number within one group, one number carrying five or more posts under at least three different names — from a
source that reports its posting order (`ordered`: extension sources do); without the order it is a `hint` with
`reason: 'no_order'`. An add numbers at once only when nothing is on disk under the folder, or when the series
kept an assignment for this source (it was removed and is added back): otherwise a folder that still holds
chapters is added in the source's numbers with a renumbering pending, for an admin to review — `pending:
'posting_order'`, or `'remap'` when the series was already numbered by posting order from another source. While a
series waits (`pending` set), it downloads nothing: its listing is kept as it was, the sweep and a bulk *Fetch
newest* skip it, and `POST /api/sources/fetch` and `POST /api/sources/fill` answer **409** `renumber_pending`.
While it is numbered by posting order it takes chapters from its numbering source alone: `POST /api/sources/fill`
from another source answers **409** `posting_order`, as does `POST /api/admin/series/:id/sources` (a follow); the
fill scan lists the series' other followed sources with `why: 'posting_order'` and asks none of them; and the
auto-follow results on a job card, the sweep's source hunt and chapter-name borrowing refuse with the same
`posting_order`. The listing, the files, read marks, floors and trackers all use the posting numbers.

### Images and OPDS
Cookie and HTTP Basic respectively, as described above.

The OPDS catalogue is 1.2 (Atom). Two extensions ride on it, both ignorable by a reader that does not know
them:

- **Page streaming (OPDS-PSE 1.1).** Every chapter entry carries a
  `rel="http://vaemendis.net/opds-pse/stream"` link whose `href` is a template,
  `/opds/book/:id/page/{pageNumber}?maxWidth={maxWidth}`, with `pse:count` (pages), and, when this reader
  has progress in the chapter, `pse:lastRead` and `pse:lastReadDate`. `{pageNumber}` is **zero-based**, per
  the spec and the same base as `read_progress.page`. Panels, Chunky and KOReader read page by page over
  this instead of downloading the CBZ; everything else keeps using the acquisition link. Without `maxWidth`
  the original bytes are served (shared cache with the web reader); with it, a JPEG no wider than asked
  (64–2000).
- **Facets (OPDS 1.2 §7).** `/opds/series` and `/opds/search` carry `rel="http://opds-spec.org/facet"`
  links in four `opds:facetGroup`s -- Sort, Library, Genre, Status -- each with `thresholdCount` (how many
  of *your* series it leaves) and `opds:activeFacet` on the one in force. The matching query parameters are
  `sort` (`updated|title|added`), `library`, `genre` (case-insensitive) and `status`; they combine with `q`
  and with each other, and `next` links carry them. Counts come from the same gated source as the listing,
  so a genre that exists only in a library you cannot open is not listed.

`<updated>` is honest: a series carries its newest chapter's time, a chapter its own, and a feed the newest
of its entries. It used to be "now" on every fetch, which defeated readers' change detection.

**The cover proxy.** `GET /img/sources/cover?u=<url>&source=<id>&w=400|800|1600` fetches a remote cover
same-origin, resized to WebP, so a Discover tile never loads a third-party image in the browser. `u` is
caller-supplied and is fetched through the SSRF guard: a value that is not an `http(s)` URL, or that
resolves to a private, loopback, link-local or otherwise blocked address at any redirect hop (four at most),
is answered with the grey placeholder image (**200**, not cached) rather than an error, since a bad value
cannot be retried into working; a missing `u` is **400**; a genuine upstream failure is **502**, so the
client can retry the direct URL itself. The only URL fetched **without** that guard is the extension
engine's own thumbnail, `<SUWAYOMI_URL>/api/v1/manga/<id>/thumbnail` — the engine's origin is a private
address on purpose, and its covers are proxied through it. Since v0.37.0 that exemption is one path shape,
not one origin: the URL on the wire is rebuilt from the configured engine base plus the numeric manga id,
and it is fetched only if it round-trips to exactly the origin and path the caller named, so no other path
on the engine (and nothing on any other host) is ever fetched with the engine's credentials, and a redirect
from it is refused rather than followed.

**The automatic banner** (since v0.51.0). `GET /img/series/:id/hero[?ar=tall][&v=<seed>]` is a banner made from
the series' own pages, for a series with no banner of its own: four crops from different chapters, side by side
(1920x640 JPEG), or two by two with `ar=tall` (1080x1440). It is gated as the series' cover is, then answers **404**
for a series that may not have one — a banner of its own (AniList's or an admin's), 18+ by any rule (its own or an
admin's rating, an 18+ library, one of the admin's 18+ genres, an adult source), an AniList lookup not done yet, or a
last try that made none, which is left alone for a week — and **404** when a try made now makes none, so a client
keeps its usual art. Every series in a payload carries `autoHero`: `{seed}` once its banner is made (`v` is that
seed, a cache-buster only), `null` otherwise — not made yet included, so a client asks only for a banner that is
there. `POST /api/admin/series/:id/hero/shuffle` (admin) picks a new seed and makes
the banner with it before switching: `{ok: true, seed}`, or `{ok: false, error: 'not_made'}` with the old banner kept,
or since v0.52.0 `{ok: true, seed, same: true}` when the series' pages give no other banner (a short series whose few
good crops are all on the one it has; nothing changes, and `seed` is the one it had); **409** `not_automatic` for a
series that may not have one. Banners are made one at a time server-wide: by a paced
background pass (twenty minutes after start, then daily), for a series soon after its backdrop is asked for, by
Shuffle, and by this route when its cache misses; the background ones stand aside for a sweep, a repair or the daily
source check.

Since v0.38.0. Enough of Komga's API for Mihon's **Komga** extension to browse and read this library
and for Mihon's **Komga tracker** to sync reading progress back — the set of `GET`s the current extension
actually calls (it uses none of Komga's newer `POST …/list` forms), plus the two tracker calls. How to set
the phone up, and what the sync can and cannot do, is in [USAGE.md](USAGE.md#the-other-direction-uchiyomi-inside-mihon-or-tachimanga)
and [extensions.md](extensions.md#komga-compatible-api); this is the wire contract.

**Authentication** is the one described under *The Komga-compatible surface* above: `X-API-Key`, then
`Authorization: Bearer`, then Basic with the token as the password, else the `UCHIYOMI-SESSION` cookie those
requests mint. Explicit beats remembered: a presented credential that does not resolve is **401** even
beside a valid cookie — `X-API-Key` *The API key is not a valid Uchiyomi API token.*, Bearer *The bearer
token is not a valid Uchiyomi API token. Account sessions are not accepted here.*, Basic *Use an Uchiyomi API
token as the password. Account passwords are not accepted here.*, any other `Authorization` scheme or no
credential *Send an Uchiyomi API token as X-API-Key, as a Bearer token, or as the HTTP Basic password.*; after
ten such failures from one address in five minutes every request from it that presents a credential is
**429** `too_many_requests` *Too many failed API keys from this address. Try again in a few minutes.* with
`Retry-After` until the window ends (no-credential and cookie-only requests are neither counted nor blocked).
A cookie that does not verify (a real Komga's `KOMGA-SESSION`, a tampered or expired value, any spelling other
than the one the server minted — `v1.<tokenId>.<exp>.<mac>`, decimal, no leading zeros) is simply "no
cookie", never a refusal on its own; a cookie that verifies but names a token that is gone — revoked,
expired, owner disabled — is **401** *This session's API token is no longer valid.* A token without `write`
browses and reads but gets **403** `forbidden` on the two `PUT`s, which is what a read-only token in the
extension looks like: nothing syncs in either direction, because Mihon retries a failed push a few times
with backoff, then gives up quietly until the next chapter read. Anything the token's account may not see
is **404**, never **403**. The cookie is set `HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax; Path=/`, `Secure` only over HTTPS (a
LAN install is plain HTTP and the WebView refuses a Secure cookie set over it), `Max-Age` = min(7 days, the
token's remaining life), no `Domain`; it is re-minted when absent, invalid, minted for another token (the
extension's key was changed to another account's — otherwise the tracker's credential-less `PUT` would keep
landing on the old account) or past half its life, and never on a 401. That re-mint needs a credentialed
request, which the API key field sends every time; with username/password the extension only presents the
password after a 401, so a changed password is not noticed while the previous cookie is valid (up to 7
days) — revoke the old token, or use the API key field. `POST /auth/logout` clears the cookie from a
browser too. Every JSON answer carries `Cache-Control: no-store`, because both clients send `max-age=600`
as a request directive against a disk cache and a cached progress `GET` could follow a `PUT`.

**Shapes.** Lists are Spring's page envelope with all nine keys — `content, empty, first, last, number`
(0-based)`, numberOfElements, size` (1–500, default 20)`, totalElements, totalPages` — because the Kotlin
client refuses a missing one, and `last` is true on the final page and on an empty one. Every DTO is padded
with every field Komga's classes declare without a default (the `*Lock` booleans, `titleSort`,
`fileLastModified`, `mediaProfile: 'DIVINA'`, …), and every string that could be null upstream is `''`:
one JSON `null` in a non-nullable field fails the decode of the whole list it sits in. On a chapter,
`sizeBytes` is the file's size on disk (`lib_books.size`; 0 when never stamped) and `size` is Komga's text
for it (`1.5 KiB`, `0 B`), which the extension shows in its default chapter name `{number} - {title}
({size})`.
Every date-time is `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss` in UTC with no zone letter and no milliseconds — the extension
parses chapter dates strictly and a trailing `Z` or `.sss` would date every chapter at the epoch — a
required date that is not known is `1970-01-01T00:00:00`, and `releaseDate` is `yyyy-MM-dd` or null.
`metadata.status` maps the stored value, case-insensitively: *Completed*, *Complete*, *Finished*,
*Publishing finished* and *Ended* → `ENDED`; *Cancelled*, *Canceled*, *Dropped*, *Abandoned* → `ABANDONED`;
*On hiatus*, *Hiatus*, *Paused* → `HIATUS`; *Ongoing*, *Publishing*, *Releasing* → `ONGOING`; anything else
goes out upper-cased with spaces as underscores (empty stays empty), which the extension shows as *Unknown* —
never a guessed *Ongoing*. The `status` filter runs the same table the other way, so `status=ENDED` finds a
series stored as *Completed*. On a chapter, `number`, `metadata.numberSort` and
the progress endpoint's numbers are **one quantity**, the override-aware chapter number, unrounded: the
extension makes it the chapter number and Mihon compares and `PUT`s it back in that unit; `metadata.number`
is the display string. The scanlation group rides as an author with role `translator`, which the extension
turns back into the scanlator. `media.status` is `READY` for a chapter whose file is on the server and
`ERROR` for a tombstone (both `READY` under *ghost chapters* below). The full field lists are in [`openapi.yaml`](../bff/openapi.yaml) under
`KomgaSeries`, `KomgaBook`, `KomgaPageDto`, `KomgaReadProgressV2` and `KomgaUser`, and
`bff/test/komgaContract.test.ts` pins the required-field lists copied from the two clients' sources.

**Browsing.** `GET /api/v1/libraries` is the extension's log-in probe and its Libraries filter — the grants
and the age cap apply, and an 18+ library is listed only to a token minted with `showAdult` (`root` is empty,
`unavailable` false). `GET /api/v1/series` takes `search` (empty = none), `page` (0-based), `size`,
`unpaged`, `sort` (`metadata.titleSort | name | createdDate | lastModifiedDate | relevance | random`, then
`,asc|desc`; the extension's Popular is `metadata.titleSort,asc` and its Latest `lastModifiedDate,desc`;
`relevance` and anything unknown are title order), and the filters `library_id`, `status`, `genre`, `tag`,
`publisher` (the extension joins several values with commas in one parameter), `read_status`
(`UNREAD | IN_PROGRESS | READ`, repeated) and `author` (`name,role`, repeated) — both the comma-joined and
the repeated form are accepted for every one of them and flattened. `tag` filters genres and `publisher` the
author field, since that is where the DTO presents them; `status=ENDED` also matches *Completed* and
friends. A filter the query cannot express is **400** `unsupported_filter`, never silently widened.
`/api/v1/series/latest` is that list with the sort forced (PR #51 exposed it; the extension never calls it).
`GET /api/v1/series/:id` resolves by id — visible, not browsable, so a series in an 18+ library the token
does not list still answers — and carries the account's real `booksReadCount / booksUnreadCount /
booksInProgressCount`, which Mihon turns into *Unread / Reading / Completed*. `GET /api/v1/series/:id/books`
is the chapter list, ordered by the override-aware number then file; the extension asks
`unpaged=true&media_status=READY&deleted=false`, where `unpaged` is one page of everything — `size` is the
chapter count (at least 1), `number` 0, `first` and `last` true, `totalPages` 1 (0 for an empty series), and
no 500 cap, so a 600-chapter series comes back whole; the paged form (`page`, `size`) stays capped at 500 —
and `media_status=READY` leaves tombstones — chapters deleted from the server, whose page list is empty —
out of the **list** only; they still count for progress. `GET /api/v1/books/:id/pages`
numbers pages from **1**, as Komga does and as the extension puts them in the image URL, and
`GET /api/v1/books/:id/pages/:n` serves the original bytes (**400** `bad_page` below 1; `?convert=png` is
accepted and ignored), the same bytes and cache as `/img/lib/books/:id/page/:n`; the two thumbnails are the
same bytes as their `/img/lib/…/thumb` twins (`?w=800|1600` on the series cover). Every image is served
`Cache-Control: private` — the whole image cache is, since this release, because those bytes are authorised
per viewer and `public` told a shared proxy they were the same for everyone. `GET /api/v1/books` (the
extension's Books search type) is always an empty page: there is no chapter-level search. `genres` and
`authors` (each `{name, role: 'writer'}`) are real over the browsable series; `tags` and `publishers` are
`[]`; `collections`, `collections/:id/series` and `readlists` are **empty pages** on purpose — a collection
would name series this credential's cap or grants hide, and an id is a disclosure — and `readlists/:id` and
its progress are **404** in both directions. `GET /api/v2/users/me` is Komga's UserDto for the token's
account: `email` is the username, `roles` `['USER']` or `['ADMIN', 'USER']`, `sharedAllLibraries` /
`sharedLibrariesIds` from the grants, `ageRestriction` `{age, restriction: 'ALLOW_ONLY'}` from the cap or
null.

**Progress.** `GET /api/v2/series/:id/read-progress/tachiyomi` counts every chapter of the series (tombstones
included — members' history refers to them), reports `lastReadContinuousNumberSort`, the number of the last
chapter in the **leading** run of completed chapters ordered by the override-aware number (chapters 1, 2 and
4 read reports 2; nothing read reports 0, and so does a run that ends on — or starts with an unread —
number-0 chapter, which the protocol cannot express), and `maxNumberSort`, the highest chapter number;
**404** unless the series is visible to the token's account. `PUT` with `{"lastBookNumberSortRead": n}` (a
finite number from 0 to 1 000 000 000, else **400** `bad_request` *lastBookNumberSortRead must be a finite
number between 0 and 1000000000.* — the value is bound as a Postgres `real`, and 1e300 used to be a 500)
marks every not-yet-completed chapter whose number is ≤ n completed in one statement —
page moves to the chapter's page count and never backwards, chapters already completed are untouched and
nothing is ever un-marked, because the protocol has no unread — answers **204**, is idempotent, and pushes to
AniList / MyAnimeList / Kitsu once, only when something changed (Mihon `PUT`s on every bind and refresh, so a
library update of two hundred bound series would otherwise have been two hundred remote mutations). `n ≤ 0`
is a no-op **204**: a fresh bind sends `0.0`, and a chapter numbered 0 (*Extra*, *Oneshot* — any file without
a digit) must not be marked read by it; Mihon never reports a chapter it read as 0, so nothing is lost. The
first real sync (n ≥ 1) marks a number-0 chapter read on both sides, as Komga does; only the bind-time 0 is
ignored. No
reading event is written, so a sync from the phone does not count towards streaks, the leaderboard or
Wrapped, exactly like the app's own bulk mark-read. Needs the `write` scope.

**Notice chapters** (opt-in, *Settings → Notice chapters*, `hideNoticeTypes`, off by default). Many sources post
announcements as a chapter numbered after the latest with a fraction (100.1, 100.5). For a series that hides them,
every chapter whose effective number is not whole is absent from this API: not in `/api/v1/series/:id/books`, a
404 by id, not counted in `booksCount` or the read counts, and not a ghost. `readProgressV2`'s run skips them,
so an unread 100.5 does not stop `lastReadContinuousNumberSort` at 100. Switching it off lists them again on the
next request. See *Notice chapters* below.

**Ghost chapters** (opt-in, *Settings → Show missing chapters in Mihon*, `komgaGhostChapters`, off by
default). Mihon takes a series' chapter total from the list this API answers, so a library running the
read-chapter cleanup was telling the trackers a thousand-chapter manhwa had one chapter, a series held under a
chapter floor reported only the part above it, and a followed series nobody has fetched reported no chapters
at all. Turned on, `GET /api/v1/series/:id/books` also lists the chapters this server does not hold: the
**tombstones** it stops filtering out (`media_status=READY` no longer excludes them), and the **ghosts** —
numbers the sources listed at the last check with no chapter row at all, from `series_listing`, whatever the
reason they are absent, the chapter floor included. They are merged into the ordinary chapter order by number,
not appended. Since v0.50.0 a `covered` number — another site's split of a chapter this server holds — is not a
ghost: the reader has the chapter, and Mihon could neither fetch it nor clear it.

A ghost's id is `g_<series id>~<number>`, the decimal point kept as a point (chapter 10.5 is `g_s_…~10.5`).
The separator is a `~` and not a `_` because `g_s_x_1_5` reads equally as series `s_x` chapter 1.5 and as
series `s_x_1` chapter 5, and a parser would have to guess; `~` occurs in neither half, and it and `.` are
both RFC 3986 *unreserved*, so the id survives a URL path segment unencoded. It carries its series so the
ordinary visibility gate applies to it, and a ghost id for a series the token cannot see is **404**, like
everything else. Both kinds report `media.status: READY` — the extension asks for `READY` and filters nothing
itself, so anything else would simply hide them — with `media.pagesCount` 0 (a ghost never had pages and a
tombstone's are gone, so neither advertises any) and `size` the literal text **`not downloaded`**, which the
default chapter-name template `{number} - {title} ({size})` renders as *1041 - Chapter 1041 (not downloaded)*
in the list, before anyone taps it. They cannot be opened: `GET /api/v1/books/:id/pages` is `[]` for both (a
tombstone's pages are gone and a ghost never had any), so Mihon shows its own empty-chapter error, and a
ghost's `pages/:n` and `thumbnail` are **404**. Deliberately not a placeholder image — Mihon marks a chapter
read once it is viewed, which would corrupt the very progress this exists to fix.

On the progress endpoint a ghost always raises **`maxNumberSort`** — the chapter total the tracker reports,
and the whole point of the switch. Since v0.43.0 a ghost can also be **marked read** (from the series page,
`POST /api/series/:id/listing-progress` above, or by the phone's own `PUT`), and a mark moves two more things,
for the reader who made it only:

- **The counts are engaged-only.** Mihon picks the tracker status with `when (booksCount) { booksUnreadCount ->
  UNREAD; booksReadCount -> COMPLETED; else -> READING }`. Counting every ghost for everyone would make
  `booksReadCount == booksCount` unreachable for a reader who never touches one, so a series they finished
  could never be *Completed* again. So `booksCount` and `booksUnreadCount` stay over the chapters this server
  has rows for, tombstones included — unless this reader has marked at least one of the series' *current*
  ghosts, in which case the counts include every ghost (marked ones read, the rest unread) and *Completed* is
  reached by marking the rest. Two kinds of mark deliberately do not count here: one on a number the listing no
  longer has, and one the **phone's own `PUT` wrote** (below) — Mihon sends that `PUT` on every bind and
  refresh, so a mark it created is this server's answer echoed back rather than anything the reader did, and
  treating it as engagement would take a series they had finished out of *Completed* with nobody having marked
  anything. Neither can make a finished series *Reading* again. `GET /api/v1/series/:id` then reports the same
  `booksCount`, so its four counts always add up.
- **`lastReadContinuousNumberSort` is the higher of two walks.** The first is v0.42.0's: a ghost is
  **skipped**, never breaking the run, so one never-fetched chapter 5 cannot pin a reader at chapter 1000 back
  to 4 and drag the tracker there on the next sync. The second treats ghosts as chapters: a marked one extends
  the run, an unmarked one breaks it — and a marked one extends it only when no whole number is missing before
  it, because a listing is only what the sources list (a licensed middle, a source starting at 200). The answer
  can therefore never fall below what v0.42.0 reported, and it rises only through a *contiguous* run of marks:
  real chapters read to 10 plus one mark on 1000 still reports 10.

With the switch on, a `PUT` of `lastBookNumberSortRead: n` also marks every listed ghost at or below `n`, so
the phone and the series page agree (the phone already shows those rows read); it writes no reading event.
Those marks do not make the reader *engaged* (above), and the `PUT` pushes to AniList, MyAnimeList or Kitsu
only when it moved real reading progress or marked a chapter **above everything this reader has finished here**
— a phone that has ticked chapters the server never fetched is telling it something new, while a refresh
echoing back the run it was just given is not, and pushing for that fired one remote write per bound series
every time the ghost setting was turned on. With the switch **off**, marks are never read
and never written here and every answer is byte-identical to v0.42.0. Tombstones are real rows with real
progress attached and were always counted correctly. Nothing else outside `/api/v1` and `/api/v2` changes:
the web app, OPDS and the offline manifest list what is on disk exactly as before.

# Single sign-on (OIDC)

Uchiyomi can sign people in through an identity provider you already run: Authentik, Authelia, Keycloak,
Pocket ID, Zitadel, or any other OpenID Connect provider.

SSO is **additional**, never a replacement. Local accounts, 2FA, lockout and session revocation all keep
working exactly as before, so you are not locked out if the identity provider is down.

## Setting it up

In your identity provider, create an OAuth2/OpenID Connect application with:

- **Redirect URI**: `https://your-server/auth/oidc/callback`
- **Grant type**: authorization code (PKCE is used automatically)
- **Scopes**: `openid profile email`

Then set these on the `uchiyomi` container and restart it (`yomi-bff` if you run the development stack):

```yaml
environment:
  OIDC_ISSUER: https://auth.example.com/application/o/uchiyomi/
  OIDC_CLIENT_ID: your-client-id
  OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET: your-client-secret
  OIDC_NAME: Authentik          # the name shown on the button
```

`OIDC_ISSUER` is the base URL that serves `/.well-known/openid-configuration`. If SSO doesn't appear on the
login screen, that URL is usually the reason: fetch it yourself and check it returns JSON.

A **Continue with …** button appears on the login screen once the issuer and client id are set. Nothing else
changes until someone uses it.

## Who is allowed in

By default, signing in through the identity provider only works for people who already have a linked account
here, which is the safe default but means nobody can get in yet. Pick one of these:

```yaml
  OIDC_LINK_BY_USERNAME: "true"   # adopt the existing local account with the same username
  OIDC_ALLOW_SIGNUP: "true"       # create an account the first time someone signs in
```

`OIDC_LINK_BY_USERNAME` is what you usually want on a server whose users already exist. The first time
someone signs in through SSO, their existing account is adopted: same account, same reading progress,
favorites and history, now reachable through the identity provider as well as their password. An account
already linked to a different SSO identity is never taken over.

Optionally map admin rights from a group:

```yaml
  OIDC_ADMIN_GROUP: uchiyomi-admins
```

When set, roles follow the identity provider on every sign-in: in the group means admin here, out of it means
an ordinary user. Leave it unset to keep managing roles in the admin panel.

## Notes

- Boolean settings read the actual word, so `"false"` means false.
- The ID token's signature is verified against the issuer's published keys on every sign-in, along with its
  issuer, audience, expiry and nonce.
- SSO sessions appear in **Profile → Account → Active sessions** as a device named "SSO" and can be revoked like any other.
- Signing in through SSO does not ask for a second factor here; your identity provider is responsible for
  that. Local password logins still use Uchiyomi's own 2FA.
