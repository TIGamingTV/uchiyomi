# Moving between layouts

Uchiyomi runs in one of three shapes, all on the same image and the same volumes:

| | containers | the database |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **one container** (`deploy/docker-compose.yml`, the default since v0.18.0) | `uchiyomi` | inside the container, on a unix socket, in the `uchiyomi_data` volume |
| external database (`deploy/docker-compose.external-db.yml`) | `uchiyomi` + `uchiyomi-db` | a Postgres container you run |
| split (`deploy/docker-compose.split.yml`) | `uchiyomi-bff` + `uchiyomi-web` + `uchiyomi-db` | a Postgres container you run |

**You do not have to move.** Every layout keeps working and every image keeps being published. The one
thing that decides which database is used is `DATABASE_URL`: set, the container talks to it; unset, the
container starts a Postgres of its own. An existing install never drifts into the embedded one by accident.

- [One container, no database container](#one-container-no-database-container)
- [External database → one container](#external-database--one-container)
- [One container → external database](#one-container--external-database)
- [Upgrading the embedded Postgres major](#postgres-upgrade)
- [From the split layout to one container](#moving-from-the-split-layout-to-one-container)
- [Adding or removing the extension engine](#adding-or-removing-the-extension-engine)

## One container, no database container

Leave `DATABASE_URL` unset and the entrypoint runs Postgres 16 inside the container: data in `/data/pg` (the
`uchiyomi_data` volume), a unix socket only -- there is no network listener, so nothing outside the
container can reach it and there is no password to manage -- and the app pointed at it before it starts.
Postgres logs into the container log alongside the app's. On `docker stop` the app finishes what it is
writing and then Postgres stops cleanly; the compose file sets `stop_grace_period: 40s` for that, because
Docker's default ten seconds would kill a checkpoint. If Postgres ever dies underneath the app, the container
exits and `restart: unless-stopped` brings both halves back in order.

Everything else is identical: the same environment, the same `/config`, `/cache`, `/library-dl` and
`/backups`, the same nightly backup task -- it dumps the embedded database exactly as it dumped an external
one, into `/backups`. Back up the `uchiyomi_data` volume like any other, or rely on that dump.

`PUID`/`PGID` apply to the database too: it runs as the same uid as the app, and the entrypoint takes
ownership of `/data` the way it does the other app-owned volumes. Postgres insists that the uid it runs as
has a passwd entry, and the owner of your library normally has none inside the image, so the entrypoint adds
one. A container started with `user:` instead cannot be given an entry, so the lookup is answered through
`nss_wrapper` the way the official Postgres image does it; such a container must also be given a `/data` it
can write.

## External database → one container

A dump and a restore. The nightly backup is already the right format (plain SQL, gzipped), so if last
night's is recent enough you can skip the first step and use it.

```bash
# 1. dump, while the old stack is still up (or take the newest file from your /backups volume)
docker compose -f docker-compose.external-db.yml exec uchiyomi-db \
  pg_dump -U yomi --no-owner --no-acl --clean --if-exists yomi | gzip > uchiyomi.sql.gz

# 2. stop the old stack. This does NOT touch volumes.
docker compose -f docker-compose.external-db.yml down

# 3. take the one-container file and start it once, so the embedded database is initialised
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/main/deploy/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs uchiyomi | grep -m1 'embedded Postgres'     # "starting embedded Postgres 16"

# 4. restore into it, over the socket, then restart so the app sees your data
gunzip -c uchiyomi.sql.gz | docker compose exec -T uchiyomi \
  psql -q "postgres://yomi@/yomi?host=/run/postgresql"
docker compose restart uchiyomi
```

Open the app: same accounts, same progress, same library. The old `uchiyomi_pgdata` volume is untouched;
delete it once you are happy (`docker volume rm <project>_uchiyomi_pgdata`).

## One container → external database

The reverse: dump over the socket, start the external layout, restore into its database.

```bash
docker compose exec -T uchiyomi pg_dump --no-owner --no-acl --clean --if-exists \
  "postgres://yomi@/yomi?host=/run/postgresql" | gzip > uchiyomi.sql.gz
docker compose down
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/main/deploy/docker-compose.external-db.yml
docker compose -f docker-compose.external-db.yml up -d uchiyomi-db
gunzip -c uchiyomi.sql.gz | docker compose -f docker-compose.external-db.yml exec -T uchiyomi-db psql -q -U yomi yomi
docker compose -f docker-compose.external-db.yml up -d
```

## Postgres upgrade

The image pins one Postgres major (16 today). A data directory written by a different major cannot be
opened by it, and rather than crash-loop on Postgres's own error the entrypoint refuses to start and prints:

```
the database in /data/pg is Postgres 16 and this image ships Postgres 17.
  It needs upgrading before it can be opened: see docs/MIGRATING.md#postgres-upgrade.
```

When Uchiyomi moves to a new major, the release notes will say so, and that release will ship as a
transition image carrying both majors that runs `pg_upgrade` on first boot. Until then, the upgrade path is
the dump-and-restore above: dump with the old image, start the new one on an empty `uchiyomi_data` volume,
restore. Nothing about your data is lost either way; the guard exists so that nothing is lost by surprise.

# Moving from the split layout to one container

Uchiyomi used to run as two containers: `uchiyomi-bff` (the API) and `uchiyomi-web` (nginx serving the web
app). It now runs as one, `uchiyomi`, where the API serves the web app itself. The single container is the
layout the install instructions use and the one the end-to-end tests actually drive.

**You do not have to move.** The split layout still works and its images are still published. This guide is
here for when you want to, and because there was no written path before.

Moving is a compose swap, not a data migration. Both layouts use the **same named volumes** and the **same
Postgres image**, so your database, downloads, config and image cache are the same files afterwards. Nothing
is copied and nothing is converted.

---

## What actually changes

| | split | one container |
| --- | --- | --- |
| containers | `uchiyomi-bff` + `uchiyomi-web` | `uchiyomi` |
| the port inside the container | 80 (nginx) | 3000 |
| published as | `${WEB_PORT:-8080}:80` | `${WEB_PORT:-8080}:3000` |
| image size on disk | 409 MB (341 + 68) | 275 MB |
| deep links | `/library` redirects to `/library/` | served directly |

Everything else is identical: the same environment variables, the same volumes, the same database, the same
`PUBLIC_ORIGIN`, the same accounts and reading progress.

## The move

Run these in the directory that holds your `docker-compose.yml` and `.env`. Keeping the same directory
matters: Compose derives the project name from it, and the project name is what prefixes your volume names.

```bash
# 1. stop the old stack. This does NOT touch volumes.
docker compose down

# 2. take the new file
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/main/deploy/docker-compose.yml

# 3. start it
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Open the app on the same port as before. You will not be logged out and nothing needs re-scanning.

> **If you keep both files around**, pass the one you mean with `-f`, for example
> `docker compose -f docker-compose.split.yml up -d`. What you must not do is run the two files as two
> different projects in two different directories: that gives you a second, empty set of volumes, and it
> will look like your library vanished.

## If you use a reverse proxy

This is the one step that is easy to forget, because nothing errors: your proxy is pointed at
**`uchiyomi-web` port 80**, and that container no longer exists. Repoint it at **`uchiyomi` port 3000**.

If you attach the app to your proxy's network with an override file, the service name changes too:

```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yml
networks:
  proxy:
    external: true
services:
  uchiyomi:                            # was: uchiyomi-web
    networks: [uchiyomi_app, proxy]
```

While you are there: the compose file publishes a host port so a fresh install works out of the box, but if
your proxy reaches the container over a Docker network you do not need that port at all. Deleting the
`ports:` entry stops the app being served over plain HTTP alongside your HTTPS domain.

## If you monitor `/healthz`

`/healthz` used to be answered by nginx with a static `ok`, without touching the API. It is now the
application's own readiness probe: it queries the database and returns **503** when the database is
unreachable. That is more useful, but it is a different thing to what you were measuring.

If you want a plain "is the process alive" check, use **`/livez`**, which answers unconditionally. The
container's own healthcheck uses `/livez` for exactly this reason.

## Rolling back

Nothing about the move is one-way, because nothing about your data changed:

```bash
docker compose down
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/main/deploy/docker-compose.split.yml
docker compose -f docker-compose.split.yml up -d
```

Then point your reverse proxy back at `uchiyomi-web:80`.

## CasaOS

The CasaOS manifest at [`deploy/casaos/docker-compose.yml`](../deploy/casaos/docker-compose.yml) runs the
app as one container next to its own `uchiyomi-db` — the external-database layout, not the embedded one, so
that installs made before v0.18.0 keep their database exactly where it already is. If you installed an older
split-layout manifest, remove the app from CasaOS and re-import this one; CasaOS keeps the volumes, so your
library survives.

# Adding or removing the extension engine

The extension engine (Mihon/Tachiyomi extensions, [extensions.md](extensions.md)) is an optional second container
beside any of the layouts above. Turning it off and on never touches Uchiyomi's own data, and never needs a
migration; the one thing to protect is the engine's own data ([extensions.md](extensions.md#your-engines-data)).

**Docker Compose (v0.49.0 files and later).** One line in `.env`, then the usual command:

```bash
echo "EXTENSION_ENGINE=0" >> .env     # off: the container goes, its volume stays
docker compose up -d
```

Delete the line (or set it to `1`) and run `docker compose up -d` again to bring it back where it left off. Compose
only accepts `0` or `1` here: the value is the engine's replica count, and any other word stops `docker compose up`
for the whole stack. Uchiyomi reads the same line, so it knows extensions are off instead of reporting an engine
that isn't answering.

**Compose files from before v0.49.0** have no switch; they keep working as they are. To get it, download the file
for your layout again — `deploy/docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.external-db.yml` or `docker-compose.split.yml`
(`curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/main/deploy/<that file>`); each has the switch — or
add its two lines to yours: `deploy:` / `replicas: ${EXTENSION_ENGINE:-1}` under `uchiyomi-suwayomi`, and
`EXTENSION_ENGINE: ${EXTENSION_ENGINE:-1}` in the app's `environment`. An install made before v0.18.0 may run the
external-database layout under the name `docker-compose.yml` (it has a `uchiyomi-db` container): replace that with
`docker-compose.external-db.yml`, never with the one-container file, which would start on a new, empty database.
⚠️ With the new file an empty `SUWAYOMI_URL=` line in `.env` really turns extensions off (the old files put the
default back, which is why that never worked); delete such a line if you want to keep them.

**Unraid and CasaOS.** Add the engine with the `uchiyomi-suwayomi` template (Unraid, from Apps) or the add-on
[`deploy/casaos/uchiyomi-suwayomi.yml`](../deploy/casaos/uchiyomi-suwayomi.yml) (CasaOS, imported as a custom
app), then set `SUWAYOMI_URL` on Uchiyomi; remove it by stopping the engine and emptying `SUWAYOMI_URL`. The
step-by-step for each, with the folder to create first, is under **Admin → Sources** while no engine is set up.
**Umbrel** cannot add an optional second container, so extensions are not available there.

## Moving the engine between setups

Compose ↔ Unraid ↔ CasaOS, or to a machine of its own: copy the engine's data, not just its settings.

1. Stop the engine on the old setup, and copy its data: its appdata folder on Unraid and CasaOS; on Compose its
   volume, `<project>_uchiyomi_suwayomi` in `docker volume ls`, most simply through the stopped container's own
   mount (never through a bare `uchiyomi_suwayomi`, which Docker would create empty):

   ```bash
   docker run --rm --volumes-from uchiyomi-suwayomi -v "$PWD":/b alpine tar czf /b/engine.tgz -C /home/suwayomi/.local/share/Tachidesk .
   ```

2. Put it where the new setup mounts it (`/mnt/user/appdata/uchiyomi-suwayomi` for the Unraid template,
   `/DATA/AppData/uchiyomi-suwayomi` for the CasaOS add-on), owned by uid **1000**: the official engine image runs
   as that user and cannot write to a folder that belongs to root (`chown -R 1000:1000 <folder>`).
3. Run the **same engine version** on both sides. Every shipped file pins the same one (a test holds them equal);
   an engine newer than the data migrates it forward, and an older one cannot read what a newer one wrote.
4. Keep the same address if you can. Covers fetched through the engine are stored with its address, so after a
   move to a new one they show as placeholders until the series' covers are fetched again.
5. Point `SUWAYOMI_URL` at the new engine. The extension sources come back by themselves within a few minutes
   (or at once with **Check again** under Admin → Sources).

**Removing it for good.** Series added through extensions stay in your library and stay readable; Admin → Health
lists them as waiting for the extension engine. Delete the engine's data only if you will never come back:
without it, those series cannot be linked to their sources again except by adding them anew.
