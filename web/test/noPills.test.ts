// "No more pills" (v0.49.0): the owner asked for the capsule shapes to go from actions, statuses and
// notices -- and for the filter and sort chips to stay exactly as they are.
//
// A capsule is anything `rounded-full` that is not a circle, or a shared class that is one (`.chip`,
// `.btn-accent`, `.btn-ghost` in app/globals.css). A circle names equal sides (`h-1.5 w-1.5`, `h-8 w-8`,
// `size-2`) and has no inline padding or minimum width: a dot or a round icon button stays allowed. A
// `min-w-[16px] rounded-full` count is a capsule the moment it says "9+".
//
// SURFACES is the list of redesigned files, SLICES the redesigned parts of files that also hold chips which
// stay (a filter row). Each later v0.49.0 step adds the surfaces it redesigns (the notices, the Downloads
// view, Health's rows, …) here in the same commit.
