// The web app, driven in a real browser, against a real server.
//
// This is the test that was missing. `web/test/` held one file of pure-function checks, and CI proved only
// that the app compiles -- so on 2026-08-23 an end-to-end pass found four user-facing bugs that were all
// invisible from the source and from a green suite of 326 server-side tests:
//
//   * the library, search and browse pages listed nothing
//   * downloading a chapter for offline reading had never worked
//   * two of the three OPDS feeds were a 500 for everyone
//   * every deep link on the documented default port redirected to a dead URL
//
// Each was a route wired to the wrong thing, which a test that imports the function and calls it cannot see.
// So this asserts the things a person would notice: pages render, the library lists what is in it, the
// reader decodes actual pixels, and the console is clean.
//
// It needs a running instance. `npm run test:e2e` brings one up from the all-in-one image; BASE=... points
// it at an existing one instead.

  // what launching an installed PWA actually does.
  //
  // This used to be documented as impossible, and it was: `refreshSession` collapsed a 401 and a dead
  // network into the same `false`, so the app could not tell "signed out" from "on a plane"; and the user
  // id lived only in memory, so even past the sign-in screen every IndexedDB key would have been `anon:` and
  // missed.
  //
  // Reintroduce by removing BOTH identity restores -- the module-load seed in lib/api.ts AND the
  // `setCurrentUser(saved.id)` calls in lib/auth.tsx. ⚠️ They are redundant, so either ALONE still passes
  // here; that was measured, not assumed. With both gone this block fails on "the offline downloads screen
  // listed no chapters", which is the assertion that separates "the sign-in screen is gone" from "the app
  // actually found your downloads".
  //
  // The other two ways to break the feature are pinned in web/test/offlineIdentity.test.ts, which is cheaper
  // than a browser run: collapsing `rejected` and `unreachable` back into one value in refreshSession, and
  // moving the `anon` branch in AppShell.tsx back below the reader hatch.
  //
  // ⚠️ THESE ASSERTIONS GO VACUOUS EASILY, and one of them already did once. A blank page satisfies "no
  // password field", and the sign-in screen satisfies "an <img> decoded" -- its own logo. So each check
  // asserts in BOTH directions: something that only exists when it worked (a downloaded page decoded from a
