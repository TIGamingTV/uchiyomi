//
// WIDTH is not read here, unlike the older walks: each phase sets its own viewports and runs at both -- notices at
// 390 and 1024, archive, numbering and sources at 390 and 1280, engine (engineWalk.mjs) at 390 and 1280. One run
// covers the phone and the wide layout; a WIDTH on the command line changes nothing.
//
// ⚠️ E2E_ARCHIVE_FAST=1 goes on BOTH commands of the every-phase run. On up.sh it starts the app with the slow
// archive's test timing; the walk reads the same flag from its own environment, and only with it runs the archive
// checks that need that timing: the Needs attention row and its two dialogs, the first chapter landing and the count
// after it, and Came in today. Without it the walk skips those and prints one line saying so; with it on a stack
// started without it they fail. On a host with less than 10 GiB free, add E2E_MIN_FREE_GB=0 to up.sh as well: the
// downloader's own floor (MIN_FREE_GB, 10 GiB) refuses every download under it, and the walks read that as a broken
// feature.
//
// The default PHASES are the ones a plain up.sh stack can serve: notices, archive, sources. numbering and engine
// need the fake extension engine (E2E_ENGINE=fake); its control port is 23000 plus the app port's last three digits
// (23149 above, as up.sh derives it), which numbering derives by itself and engine takes as ENGINE. PHASES may name
// only the five phases below: any other name is a failed check, so a typo cannot pass as a green run. The release
// plan's other phases live elsewhere: its downloads checks are run.mjs's (the walk up.sh runs by itself), and Health
// clarity is walk41's.
//
// Phases:
//
//   notices -- the capsule toasts became cards at the bottom edge (components/Toast.tsx, lib/notices.ts). The
//   owner's rule: a notice never covers a dialog's title. At 390 x 844 and at 1024 x 768 it drives a notice
//   into each place and measures it against what is on screen:
//     1. a series page: above the bottom nav (the bottom-end corner from lg up);
//     2. select mode: above the series select bar, which wraps to three rows on a phone (measured, not a
//        constant), and above the library's, which wraps to two;
//     3. a Modal over that bar (Delete from server): one card docked in the nav band, clear of the title --
//        and from lg up clear of the whole panel;
//     4. Edit details (a dialog of its own, a bottom sheet on a phone since v0.53.0; Check now on its New chapters tab)
//        and a Sheet (Sources & translations, Check now), the same;
//     5. the reader: above the chapter sheet and the settings sheet, which run to the bottom edge;
//     6. under the system's reduced motion: no turning ring (a still one), no draining hairline -- and the
//        turn and the hairline are there without it.
//   To hold a notice on screen while the walk opens a dialog under it, the mouse rests on the card: a notice
//   pauses while hovered, which is behaviour the walk relies on and so also checks. ⚠️ A card that moves leaves
//   the mouse behind and runs out: a select bar lifts it, a Modal docks it in the nav band, the reader (no nav)
//   drops it to the bottom edge and each reader sheet lifts it again. So the walk rests on it again after every such
//   move, and a held card is measured only fully shown (opacity 1): a fading card passes every geometry check, and
//   one was gone from the reader's chapter-sheet shot.
//
//   archive -- the slow archive (#117): where it is turned on and where it is watched. At 390: Discover -> the add
//   dialog's "Archive the rest slowly" (offered for Nothing yet, never for All), the done step's line, the still
//   amber cover in Library -> Downloads' Queued with the Library tab's calm mark, its sheet with Pause, Resume and
//   a confirmed Stop, and the Library selection's More -> Archive slowly. At 1280: the series page's "Archive
//   slowly" and its band, which counts the archive as the run of chapters folded under it does and whose Details
//   and Stop cover the whole screen; the admin's Pause all and Resume all, the sheet, Admin -> Settings ->
//   Downloads with its window rows, and the add dialog for a Latest-N pick; then a member who did not queue it sees
//   the cover, its sheet and the band with no key to press, and a member capped below 18 is shown nothing of Walk
//   Gap rated 18 -- no job card, archive cover or Came in today entry -- where the admin, and the same member once
//   the rating is lifted, are shown all three. No ring in any of it turns. With E2E_ARCHIVE_FAST=1 on the walk and
//   on the stack (the archive's test knobs -- ARCHIVE_FIRST_RUN_MS, ARCHIVE_MIN_BREAK_MS, ARCHIVE_PAGE_GAP_MS,
//   ARCHIVE_TICK_MS) it also holds the archive on a disk floor no host meets, to find it under Needs attention with
//   a Details and a Stop that cover the screen, then waits for the first chapter to land and be counted -- what
//   came in and what is left add up to Walk Gap's 14 chapters, on the server and on the cover and its sheet ("1 of
//   14") -- and for Came in today to sum it up. The free-space floor it lowers is put back at the end.
//
//   numbering -- posting-order numbering (#116), on the fake engine's Webtoons.com and its Istrevelia: 226 posts
//   the extension numbers 1 to 8 by the episode in their titles, 13 numbers in all. At 390: the add dialog reads
//   226 chapters with its notice, both counts (226 posts, 13 numbers) and the switch to the source's 13 numbers,
//   under which the notice's heading says they are kept, and the add keeps those; the versions sheet tells the
//   posts on one number apart by title; then the series is handed to the detector the way a v0.48.4 library holds
//   it, which holds it for review -- the notice; Health's Chapter numbering card naming it with the same two keys,
//   its Open and Source settings links, and a Review renumbering that opens the plan over the whole screen; the
//   plan that says which file becomes which chapter, Rename the files, a read mark that moved with its chapter, and
//   every file on its post's place (13 chapters on 13 numbers, the other 213 posts listed as not on the server).
//   The notice's Source settings opens the extension's own settings, whose numbering switch says no series uses the
//   source's numbers; switched there and back, it queues nothing for the series numbered by posting order. At 1280:
//   a clean webtoon's add dialog reads its own 6 chapters and shows no numbering notice (it is not added: a second
//   series on the source's numbers would change every count after it); the series goes back to the source's numbers
//   from its own notice, through the plan, with every file back on the number the source gives it (the 13, nothing
//   listed as missing); then Admin -> Sources -> Webtoons.com's Settings: its sequential-numbering switch warns
//   that it renumbers the series and asks again, and the series waits on its page for the review of the remap it
//   queued, whose rename is checked on every file the same way (13 on 13 numbers, 213 not on the server). What the
//   final wording round reworded (i18n-source-issues-2) is read on the data the components carry (the add dialog's
//   data-posts and data-numbers, the plan's data-plan-renamed) or in the English they hold when the walk runs
//   (codeEnglish), never in a copy of it.
//
//   sources -- #115, a failing source shows its failing stage in Admin → Sources (Providers until v0.54.0) and on
//   Health. fake-a's search is scripted to fail (fakeSource `error`, HTTP 500), then at 390 x 844 and 1280 x 800:
//     1. Admin → Sources -> fake-a's sheet -> Test: the running key shows its clock, Details opens on ✗ Search, never
//        "Working normally." beside a ✗, and its mark reads "Failing" (the public status is still 'ok');
//     2. a reload keeps the verdict: the sheet's Details still say ✗ Search from what was stored;
//     3. Health -> Source health lists fake-a by name among its findings (v0.53.0: one line, one key), and its
//        Details say ✗ Search;
//     4. with search scripted back to `ok`, the row's Test (its one key, or in its ⋯ menu behind Replace when fake-a is
//        some series' main source, v0.54.0) clears the finding.
//
//   engine -- Admin → Sources with the extension engine not answering, then answering, then its extensions (v0.53.0;
//   one tab since v0.54.0) on a 1,300-extension repository: the strip, the sources listed and folded, Turn on, Needs
//   attention's Update, Browse to the catalogue's last extension, the 18+ switch, an extension's sheet, its languages
//   and its closed Settings, Remove, Repositories and Languages (engineWalk.mjs). Needs up.sh with E2E_ENGINE=fake, and ENGINE=http://127.0.0.1:<the engine's port>; it takes the
//   engine down and up itself.
//
//   replace -- v0.54.0, Replace a source: at 390, 1280 and 390 in Arabic, a fake source that is the main source of
//   four series goes offline and is switched off; Needs attention and Health offer Replace, the dialog says the
//   preview's numbers, the run moves the series (at once where a working follower exists, by searching where not) and
//   is found again after Run in background and after a reload, Turn it off when done turns the source off only once
//   nothing is left on it, Make main moves a series and is refused in words for one numbered by posting order, Turn
//   off all asks first, a site in use cannot be removed, and the old Providers/Extensions addresses land on Sources
//   (replaceWalk.mjs). Needs up.sh with E2E_ENGINE=fake and E2E_FAKE_EXTRA=v54, and E2E_NET (up.sh's network) here.
//
//   Run order, whatever PHASES lists, is the release plan's (design critic): notices, archive, numbering, sources,
//   replace, engine. The engine phase resets the fake engine and takes it down, so nothing that needs it can follow; a
//   sources run that stops half-way leaves fake-a's search failing, which only the engine phase then meets, and it
//   never searches.
//
// Screenshots go to $OUT (default shots49). LOOK at them: every check here is geometry, and geometry passes on
// a card that is transparent, clipped or unreadable.
