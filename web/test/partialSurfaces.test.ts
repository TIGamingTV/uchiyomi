// v0.40.0: the surfaces of a chapter saved with pages missing.
//
// The server now keeps a chapter when at least 80 % of its pages arrived, with a flat placeholder at every
// hole and the hole numbers on the book (`missingPages`) and the page list (`missing: true`). None of that
// is visible unless the web draws it: the reader has to caption the placeholder in BOTH renderers, the series
// row has to say how many pages are short, the offline record has to keep the flag, the job cards have to
// say what was taken from elsewhere, and the admin has to be able to switch the hunt off. Each of those is
// a few lines in a large file that a type check cannot miss and a browser walk covers once -- so, like
// settingsConsole.test.ts, these read the source. Every guard names the edit that makes it fail.
