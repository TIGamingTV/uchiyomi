// It was one `await api('/api/sources/search-all?q=')` behind eighteen skeletons until EVERY source had
// answered, and a Cloudflare source has a ninety-second budget, so "takes forever" was the accurate
// description. The server now answers within `wait=` with whatever has landed and says who is still being
// asked; the page polls while `pending` is non-zero and the wall fills in. Read from source, like
// wall.test.ts: whether the search is keyed on the SUBMITTED term, whether the poll reads `pending`, whether
// only the first request waits the long wait, whether an abandoned request is aborted, and whether the
// skeletons make way for the first answer. Each guard names the edit that fails it.
