// #71, "laggy on a modest PC": the Reduce effects switch, and the look it must never cost anyone else.

// So the fix is a switch, and the finish -- the drifting mesh, the grain's overlay blend, the vignette over
// the content -- stays exactly as v0.42.0 drew it for everyone who does not flip it. Half of this file pins
// that look so that nobody "optimises" it away later; the other half proves the switch really turns the
// costly things off, applies before the first paint, follows the account, and leaves prefers-reduced-motion
// doing precisely what it did before. Every guard names the edit that makes it fail again.
