// A panel that scrolls over the page has to opt out of Lenis.
//
// Lenis drives smooth wheel scrolling for the whole app (app/providers.tsx). It reads a wheel event, walks
// up from its target looking for `[data-lenis-prevent]`, and -- finding none -- scrolls the PAGE instead of
// whatever was under the pointer. So a dialog or sheet that is `overflow-y-auto` still cannot be scrolled
// with a wheel unless it carries that attribute: the CSS says it scrolls, the app says otherwise.
//
// It only shows up on a short window, which is what makes it easy to ship: the panel fits on the machine it
// was built on, and the rows past the fold are simply unreachable for everyone else. The reader's settings
// sheet lost its last three rows that way -- reading direction, repeated pages, and the per-source default.
//
// `Sheet` in components/ui.tsx says this in a comment ("not optional"); this is that comment as a test.
//
// ⚠️ Not only overlays, and not a list someone has to remember. Lenis 1.3 leaves `allowNestedScroll` off, so a
// short list INSIDE the page (a folder picker, "Add to collection") is just as dead to the wheel, and the list
// of files this test first checked missed v0.47.0's chapter preview a day after it shipped: the wheel scrolled
// the page behind a full-screen viewer and the chapter never moved. So every file under app/ and components/
// is read, and every element that scrolls must carry the attribute -- even one inside a panel that already
// does, where it changes nothing, because "covered by an ancestor" is exactly what a later move breaks.
