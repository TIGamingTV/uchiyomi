// aqua, the owner's main source, served only its own "temporarily offline" page for days; 189 of its 195 series had
// no second source, and Health blamed the site's markup. The server runs ONE calm search at a time for other sources
// (POST /api/admin/sources/find) and words nothing itself; these hold what the page makes of it -- the words, the four
// groups of results ('not tried' is never 'nothing found'), the one-run-at-a-time gate, which answer ends a press,
// where each key posts, and the wording of the new diagnosis. The pure rules are lib/findSources.ts; the wiring is read
// from source, as healthActions.test.ts does. The idea, the other-names list and the name parsing are @TIGamingTV's
// (PR #119).
