// "Import your library" where a new owner starts (v0.55.4, #158).

// DannyDynamite39: "I have found the import, god damn it's way too buried, it should be the first thing that gets
// recommended when the server is set up." It was Admin → Sources → Add sources → Import a list, while a new server
// opened on a Library that said "Your library is empty." and nothing else, and a Home whose one key, "Browse library",
// led to that page. CI's browser walk never sees an empty library (test/e2e/up.sh seeds one; only walk49's find phase,
// on E2E_EMPTY_LIBRARY=1, does), so the wiring is read from source here, and who is offered what is called.
