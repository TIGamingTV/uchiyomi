// The add dialog's step after picking a source (v0.40.0).
//
// Picking a source fetched its series and chapter list in an effect with a request counter and hid the
// WHOLE dialog body behind "Loading…" until it landed -- the second "takes forever" the owner reported, and
// the one that hid the way back to another source exactly when a slow source made it the thing to tap. The
// detail is now a keyed query (a second pick of the same source is instant), a group with a choice to make
// pre-warms its first two providers as it opens, and the body paints at once with only the count, the
// groups and the chapter <select> waiting. Read from source, like wall.test.ts; each guard names the edit
// that fails it.
