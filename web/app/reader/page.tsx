 * The caption over a page the source never served (v0.40.0).

 * The server saved the chapter short -- at least 80 % of its pages arrived -- with a flat panel at this
 * index, so the page count, progress and spreads are all unchanged; the one thing a reader cannot tell from
 * the panel is WHY it is blank. This says why, names the source when the reader can be told one, and says
 * what happens next (the sweep re-asks for the holes). Both renderers draw it inside the page's own box.
 *
 * ⚠️ `pointer-events-none`, and no button: a tap on it must be the tap it always was -- chrome toggle,
 * double-tap zoom -- because the scroll container owns those gestures and reads them from the same
 * pointerdown/up pair. There is nothing to do here by hand anyway: the retry is the server's, not the
 * reader's. Reintroduce by making the caption a <button>: a tap on a missing page stops toggling the chrome.
