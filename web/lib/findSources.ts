/**
 * Find other sources, and the other names a series goes by (v0.49.1): the part with no React in it, so a test can
 * hold the words and the rules.
 *
 * Why: aqua, the owner's main source, has served only its own "temporarily offline" page since 2026-09-23, and 189
 * of its 195 series had no second source to take new chapters from. An admin can now ask the server to look for
 * other sources for every series of a source (Health), for a selection (Library), or for one series (Sources &
 * translations): ONE calm run at a time on the server, 1.5 s between series, pausing for a chapter sweep, a repair
 * or the daily check, and following a source only where autoFollow's judgement (title and chapter numbers) says it
 * is the same series. The other names are what that search asks under besides the title.
 *
 * The idea, the other-names list and the name parsing are @TIGamingTV's (PR #119), rebuilt server-side on the
 * existing follow machinery (bff lib/autoFollow.ts, lib/sourceHunt.ts).
 *
 * Review first (v0.51.0, #132; @TIGamingTV's idea from PR #133): the same run, which follows nothing and keeps each
 * series' matches -- with their covers -- for an admin to follow or skip one by one. Automatic stays the default; the
 * start dialog offers both and remembers the admin's last choice on this device.
 *
 * ⚠️ 'not tried' is not 'not found'. A series the run never reached -- stopped, out of time, or cut short by a
 * restart -- says so in its own words and its own section, and is offered again; reading it as "no source has it"
 * would send the admin away from a series nobody searched for.
