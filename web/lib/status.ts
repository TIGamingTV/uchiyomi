/**
 * Status as a mark and a word, not a capsule (v0.49.0, "no more pills").
 *
 * The owner asked for the pill shapes to go: Health's "All good" / "Worth a look" / "Needs attention"
 * badges, the source card's "ok", the engine's "ready". What replaces them is a shaped glyph plus coloured
 * text with no fill (components/StatusMark.tsx), and this is the vocabulary it draws from, apart from React
 * so a test can hold the mappings.
 *
 * The SHAPES carry the meaning, not only the colours: check, diamond, triangle, open circle, dash. Today's
 * capsules differ only by tint, which a colour-blind admin reads as three identical badges.
 *
 * ⚠️ Every class string here is a literal, for the reason lib/ring.ts gives: Tailwind only compiles what it
 * can find written out.
