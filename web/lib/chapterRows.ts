 *     number) is in `expandedRuns` keeps that line, marked `open`, with its ghosts following it as ordinary
 *     ghost rows (asked for on #40: the sentence used to point at a dialog, now it unfolds);
 *   * `archive` ghosts (#117) collapse the same way into runs of their own, and a run is only ever one kind:
 *     a floor number between two archive numbers (a capped one, say) ends the archive run and starts a floor
 *     run, so each line's sentence stays true of every number under it;
 *   * when `!showAll` and there are more than `GHOST_CAP` other ghosts -- an expanded run's ghosts count
 *     as "other" the moment it is opened -- the `GHOST_CAP` nearest the highest on-disk number are kept
 *     (those are the ones the reader is about to reach; for an opened run that is the newest of the older
 *     ones) and a `more` row says how many are folded away.
 *
 * `books` is taken in ASCENDING order, as the API returns it; `asc` says which way the list is read. The
 * run row stays ABOVE its ghosts in both directions: it is the heading of that stretch, and a heading under
