 * providers tab is super cluttered and non user friendly … i have to go one by one test and find replacement sources".
 * The two tabs were one source list cut three ways (Providers, Extensions, and Health's Source health), with five
 * off-switches over three stores and no way at all to move a series off a dead main source. Now one tab lists every
 * source of every kind from one answer (GET /api/admin/sources/overview), says each in one line, and offers at most
 * one key per row; a dead source's series move with one press, Replace.
