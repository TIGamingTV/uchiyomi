/**
 * What a source was seen doing, as the admin screens say it (#115, v0.49.0): the part of
 * components/SourceEvidence.tsx with no React in it, so a test can hold the words and the rules.
 *
 * "Manga Ball (EN)" failed its Test while its Providers card (Admin → Sources since v0.54.0) said "ok" and Health said "All good", and the one
 * line the Test did show read "Working normally." under a ✗. The server now keeps evidence per STAGE (search,
 * chapter list, page list, images: bff/src/lib/sourceEvidence.ts) and this turns either kind of answer into the
 * same lines:
 * - a live Test answer (POST /api/admin/sources/:id/test): its checks, its diagnosis, whether it ran out of time;
 * - persisted evidence (Health's source rows, GET /api/admin/sources): one StageLine per stage, and the last
 *   live verdict (`live` / `tested`).
 * Both render through ONE component, so Providers and Health can never describe the same source two ways.
