 * fetches a chapter every quarter of an hour or so, for days: counted like any other download it would turn
 * the Library ring for a week, poll the server every 2.5 s for a week, and put a Running cover up for every
 * chapter it takes. The owner's call: the ring animates for normal downloads only, and the archive lives in
 * Queued with a still mark. So `downloadSections` puts it in Queued, `navRing` never counts or turns for it
 * (it shows the still "slow" mark when the archive is all that works), and `jobsPollInterval` never speeds
 * up for it. One rule, three readers, each with its own test in serverDownloads.test.ts.
