/**
 * The server's sentences in the reader's language (v0.49.1).
 *
 * Health's summaries, explainers and rows, the header's headline, a source's diagnosis, a download's reason, a
 * refused renumbering or extension setting: the server writes each in English, and the page used to print it as
 * sent, so every finding read in English in all eight languages. The server now sends each with a code and what
 * fills it (bff lib/said.ts, the `…Said` fields), and this words the codes -- numbers counted in pairs, dates and
 * times in the reader's own locale and time zone (the English prints UTC with no zone).
 *
 * A line is a list of parts, each saying how it joins the one before it; they are joined the way the reader's
 * language punctuates ("；" in Japanese and Chinese, "؛" in Arabic). A code this build does not know -- a newer
 * server -- makes the whole line the server's English, never a line half in each.
 *
 * ⚠️ A code added in bff lib/said.ts (or a FixCode, or a DiagnosisCode) needs its words here in the same commit:
 * web/test/said.test.ts reads the server's registry and unions, fails by the code's name, and holds this English to
 * the server's wherever the two are meant to read alike.
