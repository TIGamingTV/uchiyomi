 * The one-line outcome shown beside a background task in Admin.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in the admin page because it is the only part of that page with real branching, and
 * every branch exists because of a run that reported nothing useful. A sweep in which every source was down
 * and one in which nothing was new both rendered "+0 chapters", so a library that had quietly stopped
 * updating looked exactly like a quiet week.
 *
 * Duck-typed on the shape of the result, because the tasks endpoint returns whatever the job stored: `added`
 * is the chapter sweep, `bytes` the backup, `refreshed` the extension check.
