// What Admin → Sources says, step by step, when the extension engine is off, not set up or not answering
// (#72), with no React in it so the steps can be tested line by line (web/test/engineSetup.test.ts).
//
// Adding the engine is a different job on each platform -- a line in .env on Compose, a second template on
// Unraid, an imported add-on on CasaOS, nothing at all on Umbrel -- and until v0.49.0 the tab had one sentence
// for all of them, which told a Compose admin who had just set EXTENSION_ENGINE=0 to "put SUWAYOMI_URL back". So
// each platform gets its own steps, the page opens on the one the server guessed (bff lib/platform.ts), and the
// platform chips switch between them.
//
// ⚠️ Commands and names are never translated: a step's sentence is a key (declared below for the string
// extractor), and anything someone copies -- a command, a path, a variable -- is a literal, shown as code. A
// translated `docker compose up -d` is a command that does not run.
