 * What every Health action does, how, how long it usually takes, and what it left behind (v0.49.0).
 *
 * The owner, about Admin -> Health: you cannot tell what each fix does, how it does it, how long it takes, or
 * whether it worked. The answers were in the code and nowhere on the page: "Fix all" on the failures card
 * reset week-old rows and re-checked nothing; "Reset solver sessions" on one row reset every source that
 * blamed the solver; "Fix all issues" promised no source would be unblocked while its solver step unblocked
 * them. This is ONE registry of the words, next to the server's limits and estimates, so a sentence cannot
 * drift from what the press does without a test here noticing.
 *
 * ⚠️ Each later v0.49.0 step that adds a HealthAction adds its entry here in the same commit
 * (healthActions.test.ts holds the union and this registry to each other). Every sentence is a tr() key, and
 * every count has its singular and its plural (web/test/localeCoverage.test.ts).
