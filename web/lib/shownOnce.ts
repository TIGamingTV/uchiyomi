// State that must survive an accidental remount.
//
// I18nProvider remounts its whole subtree when the language changes (`<div key={lang}>` in
// lib/I18nProvider.tsx) because `t` is a plain import that nothing is subscribed to. That is a deliberate
// trade and it is fine for every screen except three, where a value is shown EXACTLY ONCE and cannot be
// retrieved again:
//
//   * the OPDS password, in ProfileConnections
//   * a freshly minted API token, in ProfileConnections
//   * the 2FA recovery codes, in ProfileAccount
//
// Tap a language chip while any of those is on screen and it is destroyed permanently, along with a
// half-finished 2FA enrolment mid-QR-scan. Nothing warns, and the value is genuinely unrecoverable: the
// server stores a hash.
//
// So these three live in a module-scoped map instead of purely in component state. A remount reads the value
// back rather than losing it. Deliberately NOT localStorage or sessionStorage: a secret shown once should not
// outlive the tab, survive a crash, or be readable by anything else on the origin. Cleared on sign-out.
