/**
 * Every way to narrow the library, in one place, as labelled sections.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS ONE DEFINITION WITH TWO PLACEMENTS, and that is the point of it existing at all. The library
 * used to spread its controls across three horizontally-scrolling chip rails in the page header -- four
 * sorts, a Filters button, an 18+ toggle and a Select toggle in a single row of seven, with the library tabs
 * above them and a hand-rolled copy of the Sheet primitive holding the rest. Nothing said which chips were
 * sorts and which were filters, and the genre list inside the sheet was a flat wall of NINETY-THREE
 * unsearchable, uncounted words on the library this was written against.
 *
 * So the page renders this in a sticky sidebar from `lg:` up, and inside the real `Sheet` below it. Adding a
 * filter means adding a section here and it appears correctly in both.
 *
 * State stays in the URL, written through the page's single `setParam`. There is no draft and no Apply: a
 * tap is a navigation, exactly as it was before, so the back button still walks your filters backwards.
