// Admin → Settings: four sections on the settings grid, every row saving on its own.
//
// Until v0.39.0 this tab was a `.board` of cards of every shape with three save idioms side by side: three
// full-width "Save name" / "Save interval" buttons, switches that saved on their own with a toast, a tiny
// "Save" chip under the cleanup days, and one dirty-tracked button for the scanlator lists -- eleven cards
// with no order to them. It is now Server · Updates & schedules · Library housekeeping · Scanlators, in
// that DOM order (Server first: `test/e2e/run.mjs` reads the first 4000 characters of body text for the
// install-count payload), composed from `components/settings.tsx` so a field saves when you leave it and
// says "Saved" in one place. The only Save button left is the scanlators' one, because those are lists
// that are edited in several steps and must land as one write. Since v0.43.0 a fifth, Notifications
// (components/AdminNotifications.tsx), follows them; its dialog saves a whole target at once. After it, the
// 18+ filter: which genres and sources the "Show 18+" switch hides besides 18+ libraries. Last, the source order:
// which followed source a new chapter is taken from. After that, notice chapters: per series type, whether short
// chapters numbered with a fraction (12.5, with 3 pages or fewer) are hidden -- or, with "Only hide short ones" off
// (v0.55.3, #147), every chapter numbered with one.
//
// Toasts survive on exactly two rows, and only for the sentence the inline tick cannot say: the install count
// ("Thank you — counted" / "No longer counted", because opting out destroys the identifier) and the
// read-chapter cleanup ("Read chapters will be deleted" / "Read chapters are kept", because it deletes
// files). Every other row's outcome is its own state plus the tick.
