// "Rescan everything" (lib/rescan.ts, v0.55.4, discussion #150): the chapters whose files are gone from your own
// folders, found and shown first, then marked on Apply.
//
// The tests that matter are the ways this could destroy something or lie: a preview that calls a file gone when it
// was renamed (its old row holds everyone's reading history), when its folder could not be read, or when the whole
// volume is simply not mounted; a plan that would touch the download folder, which is Verify's; and a preview that
// changes anything at all.
//
// Driven against a real library on disk: every file is a real one-page archive, the rows are the ones persistScan
// writes, and the route is driven for real at the end (mounted admin routes).
//
// Skipped automatically unless TEST_DATABASE_URL is set (CI provides a throwaway Postgres service).
