// The desktop app never tells someone on a laptop to edit a compose file (switch ON).
//
// Every message the server writes for a Docker operator -- mount the volume, set PUID, chown, `shm_size`,
// check the container, raise SUWAYOMI_MAX_SOURCES -- goes through `forDesktop(server, desktop)`, so the server
// strings stay byte-identical and the desktop gets a sentence about Uchiyomi on this computer instead. The
// server arms are pinned word for word by 'the server arm of every forDesktop call…' below (SERVER_ARMS).
// ⚠️ Not by fsGuard.test.ts, sourceDiagnosis.test.ts or aioParity.test.ts: those match keywords only (PUID,
// 'owned by uid', FLARESOLVERR_ENABLED), so a reworded server sentence passes them.
//
// Two halves. The static one reads EVERY `forDesktop(` call under bff/src and checks both arguments, so a new
// message written later is covered the day it is added. The runtime one calls the real functions with the
// switch on, which is what catches a desktop arm that is a constant defined somewhere else.
