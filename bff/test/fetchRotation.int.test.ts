// A Fetch all spread over the sites that carry it (v0.55.4, DannyDynamite39's discussion #158), driven through the real
// route against fake sources whose pages come from fake image servers.
//
// "If the user has multiple extensions/sources that contain the same order of chapters (most of the time multiple
// aggregators offer the same scanlation) then the downloading process should round-robin the sources in order to
// decrease fetch time and decrease the chance of a cloudflare block. Mass download should also work the same."
//
// What is pinned, one behaviour per test:
//   - a Fetch whose chapters are one release on two followed sources takes them from both, two at a time, one at a
//     time on each image server, and its card counts them as one job;
//   - two sources whose pages come from one image server are one site: one chapter at a time there;
//   - a copy a person picked is never switched, nor a number they once picked a version of; a slowed site gives way to
//     one at full speed;
//   - a source the job may not ask is never taken in turn: switched off, cooling down, or past the viewer's age cap;
//   - a series with its own source order, and a job that is not a Fetch, take every chapter from the chosen copy.
//
// The image servers are PUBLIC names (img.alpha-rot.com, img.beta-rot.com): lib/pace.ts joins sources by registrable
// domain and never joins a test domain. The fetch below answers them without a network. Skipped unless
// TEST_DATABASE_URL is set.
