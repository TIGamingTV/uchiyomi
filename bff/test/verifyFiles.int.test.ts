// "Verify chapter files" (lib/verifyFiles.ts): the repair for a database restored without its chapter files.
//
// A backup never holds the chapter files, so a database-only restore leaves every lib_books row claiming
// bytes that are gone: the scan only ever upserts what it finds, and the sweep's have-set trusts the rows,
// so those chapters read "up to date" forever. The task marks such rows pruned with reason 'missing', and
// that reason is what makes the sweep fetch them again while a cleanup tombstone stays held.
//
// The tests that matter are the ways this could destroy something: a hard DELETE of the row (which takes
// everyone's reading history with it -- the first draft of this feature, PR #53, did exactly that at boot),
// marking a whole root "missing" because the volume was not mounted at the time (or because one stray file
// or one empty folder made it look mounted), and marking a READ-LIBRARY row, whose re-fetch cannot land on
// the same row and so strands the tombstone and the reading history beside a duplicate.
//
// The route is driven for real at the end (mounted admin routes): the task is detached, and "answers
// started, the panel shows the run, a restart keeps it" is a claim about the wiring, not the library.
//
// Skipped automatically unless TEST_DATABASE_URL is set (CI provides a throwaway Postgres service).
