// The library walk (lib/library.ts findSeriesDirs) on the filesystems #109 came from.
//
// v0.48.0 made the scan survive a folder the DATABASE refused, and reported it. An Unraid install was still
// missing downloads: the walk can drop folders before the database ever sees them, and said nothing. Unraid's
// user shares are one FUSE mount over several disks, which report each disk's own inode numbers, so two
// unrelated series folders could share the dev:ino the walk used as its loop guard -- and the second one, with
// everything in it, was skipped on every scan. The same walk read a whole folder as empty when one entry in it
// could not be checked, and skipped a folder it could not read without a word.
//
// None of that can be made on a test machine's own disk, so the walk takes its filesystem as a parameter and
// these tests hand it one that behaves like those mounts. No database.
