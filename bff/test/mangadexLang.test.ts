// A MangaDex title with no English chapters could not be added at all.
//
// listChapters asked for `translatedLanguage[]=en` and nothing else, so a title whose scanlations are all
// Spanish or Portuguese answered with zero chapters. Downstream that is indistinguishable from a dead
// series: nothing to add, nothing to download, no error to explain it.
//
// The obvious fix -- drop the language filter -- is wrong here, and this file pins why. Chapter numbers
// repeat across languages, and the chooser that picks one copy per number (lib/releases.ts) ranks by group,
// hosting and date; it has no notion of a preferred language. So an unfiltered feed yields a list whose
// language is chosen arbitrarily, per chapter. One language at a time, stopping at the first that answers,
// keeps the result coherent.
//
// The second half pins what the feed carries per row now that the adapter no longer collapses a number to
// one copy: the scanlation groups, expanded by `includes[]=scanlation_group`, and every release of a number.
//
// v0.52.0 (#123): the fallback is English's alone. MangaDex in another language is an adapter of its own that asks
// for its language and nothing else, and a row's language is the app's code ("es-419", never MangaDex's "es-la").
