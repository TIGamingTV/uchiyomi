//
//   - off by default: nothing is asked, nothing is touched;
//   - on: a chapter held from another group is replaced by the preferred group's copy, over the same row,
//     restamped and audited;
//   - never a shorter copy, never a file Uchiyomi did not download, never a hand-picked chapter, never a
//     file whose group is unknown;
//   - a failed swap waits a week; at most REPAIR_GROUPS_MAX a run.
