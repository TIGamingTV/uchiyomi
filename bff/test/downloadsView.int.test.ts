//
//   - a job card is shown by its folder's series row through browsable() -- library grants, the age cap, the
//     18+ hide -- for EVERY viewer, not only while the 18+ hide is on; a folder with no row yet (an add whose
//     first chapter is still in flight) is its starter's and an admin's, and a starter keeps their own card
//     wherever it lands (title only, then). The activity feed and a run's current series go through the same
//     helper, the run's by series id;
//   - a failed card is its starter's and an admin's on top of that (it is never swept);
//   - a card names its series (`seriesId`, from the folder's row), what kind of job it is (`origin`) and, once
//     it has failed, the chapters it did not land (`left`) -- only where POST /api/sources/fetch can redo them,
//     since that is what Try again sends them to;
//   - Cancel and DELETE answer 404 for a card this viewer is not handed, and 403 to anyone but its starter or
//     an admin, before the 409 for a running one.
