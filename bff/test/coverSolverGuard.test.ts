// A cover URL a caller hands the proxy must never reach the Cloudflare solver on the caller's say-so.
//
// `GET /img/sources/cover?u=…&source=…` is open to any signed-in reader, and `u` is theirs to choose. The
// v0.21.0 guard refused private addresses -- but only in front of the plain fetch. For a source marked
// `requiresCloudflare`, `fetchCoverImage` first handed `u` to `cfSession`, which asks FlareSolverr to open the
// URL's origin and then the URL itself, and the DNS half of the guard ran only afterwards. The cheap half
// (`isBlockedHost`) knew literal private IPs and four suffixes, not bare names, so `http://uchiyomi-suwayomi:4567/…`
// or `http://yomi-db:5432/` went straight to the solver.
//
// ⚠️ THE SOLVER IS A BROWSER, NOT A FETCH. It sits on the same Docker network as the engine and the database,
// follows redirects by itself, and runs the JavaScript of whatever page it opens -- so "the host resolved to
// a public address" is not enough either: a public page an outsider controls can redirect it, or script it,
// into the network. A caller-supplied URL therefore reaches the solver only on a host the SOURCE vouched for:
// its own admin-configured site, or a host it has actually served covers from. Library covers are not
// caller-supplied (they come from series_art) and keep the solver as before -- Aqua's covers live on a
// Cloudflare-protected CDN that answers 403 without it.
//
// The fake FlareSolverr below records every URL it is asked to open, and the assertions are on that record:
// a refused URL that still reached the solver is exactly the bug, even though the call rejects either way. Since
// v0.55.3 a backup solver (FLARESOLVERR_FALLBACK_URL) is asked whatever the main could not answer, so a fake backup
// writes into the same record ("backup: <url>"): every guard stands in front of both.
