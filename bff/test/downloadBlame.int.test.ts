//
// v0.11.0 called reportFail on any shortfall, so one flaky image put the whole source into an escalating
// cooldown. Live, that blocked mangakakalot over 98 of 101 pages and natomanga over 109 of 110, and because
// every caller breaks on `blockStatus`, a 92-chapter fill stopped after three. Over four nightly sweeps the
// library gained 26 chapters and lost 40.
