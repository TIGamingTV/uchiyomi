//   - off by default: nothing is searched;
//   - names come only from a donor that passes the follow judgement, in the series' language, by EXACT number,
//     into `chapter_name` with the donor marked -- never `title`, never over a name the chapter already has;
//   - a Spanish source, an adult source for a clean series, a disabled or cooling source is never asked;
//   - a search that throws is not reported to source health;
//   - a donor whose numbering differs is refused, and a search that found nothing waits a week;
//   - the chapter's own source naming it later wins; switching off takes back exactly what was borrowed.
