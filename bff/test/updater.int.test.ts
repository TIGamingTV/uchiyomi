// The nightly update sweep, and the difference between a quiet night and a broken one.
//
// This file is the updater's first test of any kind. That mattered, because every way the sweep could fail
// returned the same bare `added: 0` -- the series being gone, the source uninstalled, the source blocked,
// `listChapters` throwing or hanging, every chapter failing to save, or `updateSeries` throwing outright.
// `added: 0` is also exactly what a healthy night with nothing new returns, and it was all the admin panel
// ever received. The whole library could stop updating and every surface would report it was fine.
//
// That is precisely the failure the source watchdog exists to catch, and the lesson had never been applied
// to the most-used background job in the product.
//
// `listChapters` was also unbounded here while the identical call is bounded at 20s on the add path, so one
// hung site held a sequential sweep for undici's 300-second default, with every series behind it waiting.
//
// Skipped automatically unless TEST_DATABASE_URL is set.
