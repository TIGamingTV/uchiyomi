// The release pipeline and the one-click manifests, held to the shape that stops them breaking.
//
// The pipeline broke four of five releases before v0.19.0, every time the same way: arm64 built under QEMU
// on an amd64 runner, and the native-module builds either hung until the timeout or died with SIGILL. The
// fix is structural -- each architecture on a runner of that architecture, merged into one index -- and
// structural fixes are exactly the kind that get undone by a helpful edit ("let's simplify this back to one
// job"). So the structure is pinned here, as text, the way aioParity.test.ts pins the Dockerfiles.
//
// The manifests are pinned for the same reason: an Unraid template with a missing path or an Umbrel compose
// without the proxy block installs fine and then does not work, and nobody here runs Unraid or umbrelOS to
// notice. What can be checked without them is checked.
