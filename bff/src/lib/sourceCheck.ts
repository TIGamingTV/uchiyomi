// One live check of one source, shared by the admin's Test button and the daily check (#115, v0.49.0).
//
// The two used to be written twice, and had to be guarded against drifting apart (sourceWatchdog.test.ts: THE
// DROPPED VERDICT, the slow streak). They drifted anyway in the one way nobody guarded: neither recorded what it
// found where Health looks. Test wrote nothing at all; the sweep wrote a check_code nothing read. So "Manga Ball
// (EN)" failed its Test while Health said "All good". One function now runs the check, and one records it.
//
// What recording may touch is the whole design: the live_* columns and the per-stage evidence, never the cooldown
// (status, consecutive, blocked_until, last_error) and never checked_at -- see sourceHealth.ts recordLive.
