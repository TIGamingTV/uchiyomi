// Retiring a source once nothing uses it as a main source (v0.54.0): turning it off, or removing it.
//
// The owner: "can u remove any extension/providers that are not working good for me". Removing a source some series
// still read through froze them -- a site added by address was deleted with no check at all, and every series from it
// read "no longer installed" -- so a source is retired only once no series has it as its main source (`in_use`, with
// how many: "Replace it first"). Its follows go first, with their listing rows, as an unfollow takes them: a follow
// on a retired source is a listing row nothing can fetch through and a sweep ask that never answers. The chapters it
// failed for those series go to each one's main source (v0.55.3, as an unfollow sends them). Then:
//   - `off`: switched off (source_health.disabled), as Turn off does -- loaded, never asked;
//   - `remove`, a site added by address: out of sites.json and the registry, its health row pruned;
//   - `remove`, an extension's source: switched off in the extension (suwayomi_sources.enabled), which unregisters it.
//     The extension itself stays installed -- one package carries every language's sources, and uninstalling is
//     Extensions' own decision;
//   - `remove`, MangaDex, a built-in or a pack source: nothing to remove it from, so it is turned off, and the answer
//     says so (`done: turned_off`).
// The Replace run calls it with `off` when it ends with nothing left on the source it replaced (`turnOff`).
