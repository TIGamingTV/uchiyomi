// Which way a series reads (#102).
//
// Every series used to answer `readingDirection: 'WEBTOON'` from a constant in lib/ownedCatalog seriesDto, so
// the reader's "Series default" direction could never lay a page out right to left, a right-to-left double
// spread was never reassembled, a downloaded chapter carried WEBTOON to the reader offline, and the
// Komga-compatible API told Mihon that every manga was a webtoon. The direction is now learned from evidence and
// stored on lib_series, with the admin's override on series_overrides beating it, and NULL -- nobody knows --
// still reading as WEBTOON, so a series nothing speaks for behaves exactly as before.
//
// The evidence, most trusted first:
//   comicinfo  `<Manga>YesAndRightToLeft</Manga>` in the first chapter's ComicInfo.xml, read by the scanner.
//              The file says so itself, about this very copy.
//   source     what the followed source says about the title: MangaDex's `originalLanguage`. Learned when a
//              series is added, and by the nightly repair's `directions` step for series added before this.
//   anilist    AniList's `countryOfOrigin`, from the same match that already finds the art and the tracker
//              link, and from the link itself for series that have one -- only from an entry that is
//              visibly this series, unless a person made the link (directionFromAniListMatch).
// A weaker signal never overwrites a stronger one (learnDirection); the same signal may correct itself.
