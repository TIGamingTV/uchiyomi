// and turns it into "ghosts": the numbers with no lib_books row, each with the reason it is not here.

// The listing is written by the updater, not fetched when the page opens. Asking the sources from a page
// load would put every series-page visit on the sites' rate limits, and "as of the last check" is the

//
// EVERY listed number is stored, not only the missing ones. "Fetch again" needs the chosen copy of a
// number that IS on disk, and the known-group picker needs to count what a group released, held or not.
// A number's row is also the authorisation for a manual fetch: a client names numbers, and only a number
// the sources listed at the last check can be asked for -- the same footing as the fill plan, and the
// same reason (a chapter URL never crosses the wire).
