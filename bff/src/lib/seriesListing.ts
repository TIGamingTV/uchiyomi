// What the sources list for a series, kept so the series page can show the chapters this server lacks.
//
// Everything the sweep knew about a missing chapter -- held for a preferred group, failed three times,
// released only by a blocked group, below the Latest-N floor -- died with the sweep's stack frame. The
// series page could count "3 behind" from the stamps on lib_series and say nothing about which three, or
// why. This module persists the last listing (one row per number, whether or not the chapter is on disk)
// and turns it into "ghosts": the numbers with no lib_books row, each with the reason it is not here.
//
// The listing is written by the updater, not fetched when the page opens. Asking the sources from a page
// load would put every series-page visit on the sites' rate limits, and "as of the last check" is the
// honest answer anyway: the reason a chapter is missing is a property of the last sweep, not of now.
//
// EVERY listed number is stored, not only the missing ones. "Fetch again" needs the chosen copy of a
// number that IS on disk, and the known-group picker needs to count what a group released, held or not.
// A number's row is also the authorisation for a manual fetch: a client names numbers, and only a number
// the sources listed at the last check can be asked for -- the same footing as the fill plan, and the
// same reason (a chapter URL never crosses the wire).
