/**
 * Health's "Fix everything" (v0.55.0): one background run that drives every Health card it can to green, then says, in
 * short, what it did and what only a person can do.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 *   The owner, on Health's Fix all: "the auto pick and fix stuff will try its best to fix everything and keeping
 *   everything green without needing to manually do stuff cause i wana see everything green at the end idc what it does
 *   to do that even if it had to add an extension itself to find a chapter ... and for auto it just shows at the end what
 *   happened and what it did in short without cluttering". Fix all issues was the repair alone -- failures, short
 *   chapters, five series of gaps -- and it disappeared when only broken sources, frozen series, duplicates, numbering,
 *   odd chapter numbers and chapters saved twice were left.
 *
 * WHAT IT MAY DO (the owner's decisions, 2026-10-03)
 *   Everything the repair does, uncapped but paced; Test sources, and clear a block only after a passing Test; Replace
 *   every off or failing source some series reads through, and turn off failing sources nothing uses; link language
 *   editions; MERGE duplicate series whose AniList entry, language and titles or chapters agree; apply renumbering plans
 *   marked clean; DELETE the later copy of a chapter saved twice when the kept copy is complete, and chapters with an
 *   impossible number, with the delete route's own guards; install extensions, the popular first, as long as its time
 *   lasts (v0.55.1, the owner, 2026-10-04: no cap of three), keeping only those that carry something.
 * WHAT IT NEVER DOES
 *   ⚠️ Press Ignore: what it cannot fix is listed as Needs you, never hidden. ⚠️ Turn off a source some series reads as
 *   its main (it retires, which refuses). ⚠️ Clear a block without a passing Test, or a rate limit's at all (v0.55.1). ⚠️
 *   Replace a source that only asked for room, or move a series onto a source that cannot update it (v0.55.1). ⚠️ Apply
 *   a renumbering plan that is not clean (numbering.ts settleNumbering decides at the apply, from the listing it reads
 *   then). ⚠️ Delete outside the download folder, or a bookmarked chapter. ⚠️ Install more than AUTOFIX_INSTALLS a run
 *   when it is set, or try a package twice for one series within a month. ⚠️ Touch a container: a solver or an engine
 *   that is down is the operator's.
 *
 * HOW
 *   Ten phases, one after another (PHASES), each reusing the functions the Health page's own keys run -- never their
 *   routes. ONE run at a time, and never beside a repair, a Find or Replace, or a sweep: it refuses at start (`busy`,
 *   with which), a repair and a Find refuse beside it (runtime.autofixing), and between phases it waits out a sweep that
 *   started meanwhile. It holds the cross-job lock (runtime.repairing) while it scans, runs the repair's steps, merges,
 *   renumbers or deletes, so no sweep starts under those; its Replace and Find runs go through startFind's own machinery,
 *   which waits on that lock, so it does not hold it there. Stop is honoured at the next safe point -- between series,
 *   steps, sources or pairs, never inside a merge, a delete or a renumber -- and the run is recorded `stopped`.
 *   Its whole run is bounded by AUTOFIX_MAX_MINUTES (the network-heavy phases stop when it is spent, and what they leave
 *   "clears by itself: the next Fix everything continues") and its searches by AUTOFIX_SEARCHES.
 *   The record is a row of repair_runs, kind `autofix` -- no new table -- with the summary and the log as said codes
 *   (lib/said.ts `autofix.*`), which the web words: never English from the server.
