/**
 * "What is the newest published release of X?", asked of GitHub, safely.
 *
 * This was written for the Cloudflare solver and is now also used to tell an operator that a newer Uchiyomi
 * exists. Both are the same job with a different repo, so the rules live here once. Since v0.55.1 it also reads how
 * often an extension repository's release files were downloaded (releaseAssets), so Fix everything tries the popular
 * extensions first (lib/extensionRank.ts): the same public GET, the same rules.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ANSWER MUST NEVER MATTER. No network, a rate-limited reply, a tag in a shape nobody predicted:
 * every one of those means "no opinion" -- never an error, never a status of its own, never a reason for a
 * health check to fail. Knowing a newer version exists is a nice thing to know; a version check that can
 * take the health page down with it is not.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT MUST NEVER SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS INSTALL. It is a GET of a public releases endpoint. GitHub
 * learns an IP and a user-agent, which is unavoidable for any update check, and nothing else -- no version,
 * no id, no library. That is precisely what makes it safe to leave on by default, and it is why the opt-in
 * install count in installPing.ts is a SEPARATE switch pointing somewhere else. If this call ever went to a
 * server we run, "I have update checks on but the count off" would stop being true, so it must not.
 *
 * Cached per repo for a day, because unauthenticated GitHub allows 60 requests an hour per IP, shared with
 * everything else on the host.
