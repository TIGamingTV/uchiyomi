// Read marks on chapters this server does NOT hold (issue #69): "I have read chapter 57" for a number the
// sources list and the library never fetched -- a ghost row on the series page, a "not downloaded" row in
// Mihon under the ghost opt-in.
//
// A mark is a row in listing_progress (the table's note in lib/migrate.ts says why it is not read_progress and
// not a fabricated lib_books row). Everything that reads reading history -- the read-chapter cleanup, Continue
// Reading, the shelf's unread count, OPDS, stats, streaks, Wrapped -- reads read_progress and reading_events,
// and so keeps meaning "of what is actually here" without knowing this table exists. Only three things read
// the marks: the series page (lib/seriesListing's listingFor draws the tick), the Komga surface
// (lib/komgaProgress, behind komga_ghost_chapters) and the tracker push (lib/trackers' seriesProgressFor, behind
// the same switch). The rule the last two share lives here, in continuousRun, so they can never drift apart.
//
// What must never happen, each pinned by a named test:
//   1. Absence is never a read. No path infers read-ness for a number nobody marked.
//   2. A tick on a number we do not hold moves an external tracker only as part of a CONTIGUOUS run from the
//      bottom -- never a lone high tick, whose number is effectively irreversible on AniList.
//   3. The run reported to a paired phone never falls below what v0.42.0 answered.
//   4. A mark never writes reading_events: ticking a backlog is not reading in the app, and streaks, the
//      leaderboard and Wrapped must not inflate from it.
//   5. Reconciliation never makes a just-landed file due for the read-chapter cleanup.

/**
 * How far this reader has read without a gap: the number Mihon turns into `last_chapter_read`, and the one
 * the tracker push may raise AniList/MAL/Kitsu to.
 *
 * ⚠️ TWO WALKS, AND THE MAX OF THEM.
 *   `skip`   is v0.42.0's rule: a ghost is skipped, so one never-fetched chapter 5 cannot pin a reader at
 *            chapter 1000 back to 4 (and drag their tracker back on the next sync).
 *   `strict` is the rule issue #69 asks for: a ghost the reader MARKED is a chapter they read, and one they
 *            did not mark is a chapter they did not, so it breaks the run like any unread chapter.
 * The max is never below `skip`, which is exactly today's answer -- no install regresses and no paired phone
 * watches its progress drop -- and it only rises above it through a contiguous run of explicit ticks, so a
 * single tick on chapter 1000 with 989 unmarked ghosts below it adds nothing.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ADJACENCY BREAK. "The next entry in the list" is not "the next chapter": a listing is only what the
 * sources list, and sources list sparsely -- a licensed or DMCA'd middle, a follow-only series whose source
 * starts at 200, a site that shows only the newest chapter. Without the break, real 1..12 read plus one mark
 * on 951 in a listing of 951..1000 walks straight across the hole and tells AniList 951. So a marked ghost may
 * extend the run only when no whole number is missing before it; real rows are not held to that (a real row
 * is a chapter this library has, and v0.42.0's walk already passed over holes between them).
 *
 * Reintroduce by keeping either walk alone: with `strict` alone "a ghost in the MIDDLE never stalls the run"
 * (komgaGhosts.int.test.ts) fails; with `skip` alone "a follow-only series read to 5 reports 5" fails. Merge
 * them into one skip-and-extend loop and "a lone tick far ahead reports nothing" fails. Drop the adjacency
 * break and "one tick past a hole in the listing reports nothing" (listingProgress.int.test.ts) fails.
 *
 * Returns the raw number (it may be fractional, e.g. 12.5); the tracker push floors it, so a run that ends
 * on a fractional mark never tells a tracker about the whole chapter after it.

 * Stamped now(), a reconciled row satisfies that at once and the file the sweep just fetched is deleted within
 * the hour at 0 days -- and the tombstone keeps it from ever being fetched back. The mark's own time is not
 * enough on its own either: persistScan runs once at the END of a sweep, so a chapter can sit on disk while

 * carrying lp.completed_at unclamped: "a mark made after the file landed still does not make it cleanup-due"
 * in listingProgress.int.test.ts deletes the file.

 * a mark onto a chapter the survivor holds and they had started, or a scan whose reconcile failed left the
 * mark beside a chapter they then opened). That row's updated_at is when they opened THIS copy, after it
 * landed; flipped to completed while keeping it, the chapter is due at once and deleted out from under
 * someone who was partway through it. The earlier stamp keeps it until they really finish it (the reader's
 * own completed write then stamps now()). Reintroduce by GREATEST: "a mark reconciled onto a chapter the
 * reader had started leaves the file" in listingProgress.int.test.ts deletes the file.
 *
 * ⚠️ OVERRIDE-AWARE, as every ghost comparison is: matched on the raw number, a renumbered chapter would keep a
 * ghost mark forever beside its own row.
 *
 * Two statements rather than one DELETE ... RETURNING feeding the INSERT: when two files share a number (two
