 *    source running out of pagination, so counting it would turn infinite scroll into a machine for
 *    condemning the sources people use most.
 * 2. **A non-empty page reports OK, exactly as before.** The invariant documented in routes/sources.ts is
 *    preserved literally: `reportOk` still fires only when something came back.
 * 3. **An empty page records emptiness and NOTHING else.** Not `status`, not `consecutive`, not
 *    `blocked_until`. Several adapters answer a failed Cloudflare challenge with `[]` rather than throwing,
 *    so calling `reportOk` here would clear a cooldown the downloader legitimately recorded; calling
 *    `reportFail` would hand a merely quiet source a thirty-minute ban and inflate the backoff multiplier.
 *    Both were tried in the design and both are wrong. The streak is evidence, never a verdict.
 *
 * Note `reportOk` deliberately does not clear the streak -- only this function does, and only via the
 * latest path. `reportOk` is also called by the chapter downloader, and "downloads fine, but its listing
