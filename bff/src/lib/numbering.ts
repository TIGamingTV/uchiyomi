// Posting-order numbering, applied (#116): where lib/postingOrder.ts decides, this module persists and renames.
//
// A series numbered by posting order is numbered so at EVERY place a listing enters the app -- the updater's
// loop, the add, the add dialog's detail, the preview, the fill scan's own source and (through the updater's
// refresh) a manual fetch -- and nowhere else. Everything downstream of a listing (chooseReleases, the stored
// series_listing, ghosts, versions, the downloader's `Chapter N.cbz`, fill, floors, read marks, trackers)
// then sees one set of numbers without knowing numbering exists. Applying it inside the adapter was the other
// choice, and the wrong one: an adapter has no series, so it cannot know the per-series switch, the stored
// assignment or a pending review, and its detail cache is shared by every viewer.
//
// The assignment is STABLE (series_post_numbers): a post keeps its number for good, a deleted post leaves a
// hole, an inserted one takes a midpoint. Recomputing positions on every check would shift every later file,
// mark and tracker number the day a creator deletes one post.
//
// A series ALREADY in a library is never renamed unattended (the owner's decision for v0.49.0). The detector
// firing on it sets `numbering_pending`; the series then downloads nothing and keeps its listing as it was
// until an admin reviews the exact plan and confirms it (requestNumbering). The only apply that needs nobody
// is one with nothing to rename: a series with no chapter rows at all. New adds are numbered at once, because
// nothing is on disk yet.
//
// The apply, when it runs: scans held (library.ts withScansHeld), the folder busy for every other writer, a
// journal (lib_series.renumber_plan) written BEFORE the first rename, renames in two phases (every file to a
// temporary name, then every file to its final one, so two files trading numbers never meet), and ONE
// transaction for every row: lib_books updated in place -- ids, and with them read progress, bookmarks, notes
// and offline copies, are kept -- then marks, floors, failures, overrides, the archive's boundary and today's
// download log moved through the same map. The transaction clears the journal; a journal still there on the
// next check is finished from where it stopped (resumeRenumber), and until then the scan leaves the folder
// alone (library.ts).
