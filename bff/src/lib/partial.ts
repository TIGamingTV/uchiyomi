// A chapter saved with some of its pages missing, and the pass that fills them in later.
//
// The owner's report: "a missing page, like 149 of 155, causes the chapter not to be downloaded". It did --
// deliberately (partialChapter.test.ts: a truncated file skipped forever is worse than no file), and then
// the same chapter failed the same way every night until the retry cap stopped it, and the person had
// 154 readable pages they could not open. Live, 153 ledger rows were that shape, none of them a block.
//
// The answer is a file that is honest about its holes. Every page keeps the name its INDEX gives it, a
// missing page is a flat placeholder image under that same name, and a manifest at the archive root says
// which indices are placeholders. So every consumer -- the scanner, the reader's page count, page_dims,
// OPDS, the Komga-compatible API, offline manifests, thumbnails, fingerprints -- sees an ordinary chapter of
// the right length and needs no change; only /api/books/:id/pages learns to say `missing: true`, from the
// lib_books.missing_pages column, and the web draws the caption. The sweep's completion pass then asks the
// source for exactly the missing indices, merges them into the file, and clears the column when it is whole.
//
// ⚠️ The manifest carries no page URLs. They expire, and an exported CBZ would leak the source host into a
// file that travels; the completion pass re-runs getPageUrls instead.
