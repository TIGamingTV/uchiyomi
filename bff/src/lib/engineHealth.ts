// Before it, nothing on the Health page looked at the engine. extensionCap stayed green through an outage,
// the solver check pinged only Uchiyomi's own FlareSolverr, and an engine whose own Cloudflare helper was off
// (#54) made every protected extension fail while Health said "All good". The per-series rows (frozenSeries)
// say which series wait; this row says why, and what to do about it.
//
// `extensionEngine` decides from facts it is handed and is unit-tested that way; `extensionEngineCheck` gathers
// them, through the memoised probe in extensionEngine.ts so the page never waits more than a few seconds.
