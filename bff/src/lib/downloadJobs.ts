 * #82 (Wolf92s): "I can't find what's currently being downloaded." The download pill (Library -> Downloads since
 * v0.49.0, web components/ServerDownloadsView.tsx) only ever knew the jobs a person started from a button --
 * routes/sources.ts keeps those, one card per series folder. Everything the server does by itself went through `updateSeries`
 * and was invisible: a sweep fetching forty chapters at three in the morning looked exactly like a quiet
 * night until the Updates shelf filled up, and there was no way to stop one that was hammering a source.
 *
 * So each of the three runs registers ONE card while it goes -- one per run, not one per series: a sweep
 * visits two hundred series, and two hundred cards is a log, not a view -- with how far it has got, what it
 * has saved, what it is on right now, and a cancel flag the run checks between chapters. Admins only (the
 * route decides): these are the server's housekeeping, and the series a sweep is on may be in a library the
 * viewer cannot see.
 *
 * In memory, like the per-series jobs: a restart ends every run anyway, and the Tasks panel keeps the
 * persisted result of the last one.
