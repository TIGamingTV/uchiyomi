  /**
   * Fetch `indices` through up to `workers` loops that each pull the next index off a shared cursor.
   *
   * The gap is a floor between page requests across the whole pool, not per worker: each loop reserves its
   * start slot synchronously (no await between reading the clocks and advancing `lastStart`) and only then
   * sleeps until that slot comes round, so the request rate towards the source is the same however wide
   * the pool. The slot is measured from the later of the previous START and the previous COMPLETION. The
   * completion matters: the sequential loop this replaces slept `gap` AFTER each page, so a slow site got
   * `rtt + gap` between requests -- measuring from starts alone would have handed a 500ms site the exact
   * 1.9 pages/second that earned the 429s, with every pacing test still green. Results land by position
   * (`page[i]`), so reading order does not depend on arrival order.
   *
   * The loop condition, not a break, checks `retryAfterMs`: the first 429 stops EVERY worker from starting
   * another page while the ones in flight finish. Carrying on collects ninety more refusals, turns a pause
   * into a "12 of 108 pages" failure, and earns a cooldown for behaviour that was ours. Re-checked after the
   * sleep too, since a slot reserved before the 429 landed is exactly the request the site asked us not to
   * make.
   *
   * With a jitter range each page draws its OWN gap, fresh, never below `gap`: one draw per chapter would
   * still be a metronome inside it, and a metronome is what the slow archive is not meant to sound like.
