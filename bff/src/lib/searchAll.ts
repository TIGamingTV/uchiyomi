// Search every source the viewer may reach, and answer before the slow ones do.
//
// The Discover search used to be one `Promise.all` over every registered source with a 20-second budget
// each -- 90 seconds for a source behind Cloudflare -- and the page showed skeletons until the LAST one
// settled. Nothing was cached and nothing was de-duplicated, so the same title typed twice was every site
// asked twice, and a source serving out a cooldown was asked anyway and burned its whole budget. "Takes
// forever" was the accurate description.
//
// Now one search is an ENTRY, keyed by the normalised term, that fills in as sources settle. A caller waits
// for the earlier of: everything it asked for settled, its own `waitMs`, or SEARCH_GRACE_MS after the first
// source with results -- and gets the state of every source it asked for, so the client can show "5 of 12
// answered, still asking …" and poll for the rest. Work that outlives the caller continues into the entry;
// the next call for the same term, from anyone, reads it.
//
// ⚠️ The entry is the UNION across viewers and every answer is filtered to the caller's own `ask` set.
// A capped account's set never contains an adult source, so it can neither start that source nor read
// what an uncapped viewer's search got from it. The cache holds raw per-source lists (what the SITE said,
// viewer-independent) and nothing about who asked -- the filter happens on every read, never on write.
