// Sentences the server writes that the web shows, as codes the web words in the reader's language (v0.49.1).
//
// Health's summaries, explainers and rows, the header's headline, a download's reason, a refused renumbering: the
// server has always written these in English, and the web printed them as sent -- so an admin reading Uchiyomi in
// Arabic or Japanese read every finding, and every reason a download stopped, in English. Each is now built HERE,
// from a code and what fills it, and goes out twice: the English exactly as it always was (API clients and older
// web builds read that), and beside it the code with its parameters (the `…Said` fields), which web/lib/said.ts
// words. Numbers stay numbers and dates stay ISO strings, so the web says them the reader's way -- in their own
// time zone, where the English keeps the UTC it always printed.
//
// A line of several parts (a summary and its "; 2 ignored", a row's detail, a note's sentences) is a list of
// parts, each saying how it joins the one before it; `english()` joins them the way the server always did, and the
// web joins its translations the way the reader's language punctuates.
//
// ⚠️ A new sentence is a new code HERE and its words in web/lib/said.ts in the same commit: web/test/said.test.ts
// imports this registry, fails by the code's name, and holds the web's English to the English below.
// ⚠️ Pure on purpose -- no db, no env -- so that test can import it. It imports only lib/desktop.ts, which imports
// nothing of ours (a platform's own wording goes through `forDesktop` here, where desktopCopy.test.ts reads both
// arms), and lib/sourceDiagnosis.ts, pure for the same reason.
