-- Read marks on chapters this server does NOT hold (v0.43.0, issue 69): a series_listing number with no

-- assertion "this reader has read this number"; there is no completed column, because a chapter with no
-- pages cannot be half-read, and un-marking is a DELETE, the rule the library's bulk mark-unread follows.
--
-- WHY NOT read_progress. Its key is (user_id, book_id) and book_id is ON DELETE RESTRICT precisely so reading
-- history cannot be erased by a chapter row going away (the FK note below). A nullable book_id would mean
-- dropping that key for two partial unique indexes and weakening the one guarantee this project has no undo
-- for. AND NOT a fabricated lib_books row: the updater's have-set is a plain SELECT over lib_books, so a row
-- with no file is a chapter the sweep would never fetch -- the feature would silently stop the download it
-- sits beside. books_count, cover_book_id, Verify and the gap check read those rows the same way.
--
-- number is real to match series_listing.number and lib_books.number exactly; every comparison binds ::real,
-- or 12.1 arrives as 12.100000381469727 on one side only (the note on markReadUpTo in lib/komgaProgress.ts).
-- completed_at is WHEN THE PERSON MARKED IT, and persistScan carries it into read_progress.updated_at when the
-- chapter lands -- clamped to just before the file's mtime. Stamping now() there would make the read-chapter
-- cleanup delete a file minutes after fetching it (the which-copy-did-they-read rule in dueSql,
-- lib/chapterCleanup.ts), and the tombstone would make that permanent. source is 'web' or 'komga': whether a
-- person ticked it here or a paired phone's sync wrote it. ⚠️ Not a support field -- it is the difference
-- between an act and an echo. Mihon PUTs on every bind, and that PUT marks the ghosts under the run this
