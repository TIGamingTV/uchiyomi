// Notice chapters: the chapters a source numbers N.x to tell readers something.
//
// Many sites post an announcement -- a hiatus, a season break, a recruitment call -- as a chapter numbered after
// the latest real one with a fraction: 100.1, 100.5. The admin may hide every chapter whose number is not whole,
// per series type (Settings, server_settings.hide_notice_types) and per series (lib_series.hide_notices, NULL =
// the type's switch). A hidden chapter is gone from everything a person or a client reads -- the chapter list,
// next/previous, the counts and badges, Home, Updates, history, OPDS, the Komga-compatible API Mihon reads and
// what the trackers are told -- and the sweep does not download new ones (lib/updater.ts). Nothing is deleted:
// switching it off shows every one again at once, and the next sweep fetches those never downloaded.
//
// Off by default (an empty list and NULL everywhere): every fragment below is then false for every row, and costs
// one uncorrelated read of server_settings per query.
//
// ⚠️ The ONE definition. Every query that needs the rule interpolates a fragment from here, so "which chapters
// are notices" and "which series hide them" cannot drift apart between the chapter list and the counts. No
// fragment binds a parameter: they are interpolated into queries whose parameter lists are written by hand, as
// browsable() in lib/visibility.ts is. Everything they read comes from the database itself.
//
// Pure: no database (seriesTypeSignals.test.ts imports it). The reads that need one are lib/noticeSettings.ts.
