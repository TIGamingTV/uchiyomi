// Notice chapters: the chapters a source numbers N.x to tell readers something.
//
// Many sites post an announcement -- a hiatus, a season break, a recruitment call -- as a short chapter numbered
// after the latest real one with a fraction: "Ch. 44.5 - Notice!". The admin may hide them per series type
// (Settings, server_settings.hide_notice_types) and per series (lib_series.hide_notices, NULL = the type's switch).
// A hidden chapter is gone from everything a person or a client reads -- the chapter list, next/previous, the
// counts and badges, Home, Updates, history, OPDS, the Komga-compatible API Mihon reads and what the trackers are
// told -- and the sweep does not download one the source already says is that short (lib/updater.ts). Nothing is
// deleted: switching it off shows every one again at once, and the next sweep fetches those never downloaded.
//
// ⚠️ A NOTICE IS SHORT, NOT MERELY FRACTIONAL (the owner's rule, v0.55.2). A chapter numbered with a fraction is a
// notice only when its page count is KNOWN and is NOTICE_MAX_PAGES or fewer: a saved chapter's own counted pages,
// else what the sources list for its number. On the owner's library, of 1,759 chapters numbered N.x about 170 had 3
// pages or fewer -- the notices -- and about 1,500 had 6 or more: real chapters posted in parts. Any fraction would
// have hidden 779 chapters in 94 series with Manhwa switched on (118 of Omniscient Reader's). Not known is shown:
// a chapter nobody has counted yet is a chapter until it is counted (the repair counts them nightly, the reader and
// OPDS when they open one).
//
// v0.55.3 (#147, TIGamingTV's switch): unless the admin says otherwise. "Only hide short ones" (server_settings.
// hide_notice_short_only) is on by default and is the rule above; off, every chapter numbered with a fraction is a
// notice, of the types and the series switched on -- the rule #147 was first written with, real chapters a site split
// into parts included, which is why it is a choice and says so where it is made.
//
// Off by default (an empty list and NULL everywhere), and while nothing hides, nothing costs anything: every fragment
// below is then a constant (`active`), so every query is the one the previous release ran.
//
// ⚠️ The ONE definition. Every query that needs the rule interpolates a fragment from here, so "which chapters
// are notices" and "which series hide them" cannot drift apart between the chapter list and the counts. No
// fragment binds a parameter: they are interpolated into queries whose parameter lists are written by hand, as
// browsable() in lib/visibility.ts is. Everything they read comes from the database itself. Two kinds of row are
// judged: a saved chapter (lib_books, `bookIsNotice`) by its own counted pages, else the listing's for its number --
// and never a file holding a range of chapters (lib/chapterRanges.ts); and a number only the sources list
// (series_listing, `listedIsNotice`) by what the listing says.
//
// Pure: no database (seriesTypeSignals.test.ts imports it). The reads that need one are lib/noticeSettings.ts.
