/**
 * Following the other sources that carry a series, decided by the server at add time (#49).
 *
 * The manual follow (POST /api/admin/series/:id/sources) has two identity gates: the fill scan's title
 * match on the server, and a person confirming which source and which title they picked. This path has no
 * person, so it keeps BOTH gates on the server: the candidate's own title, as its source names it, must
 * match ours, and its numbering must line up with what we list. Coverage alone cannot do it -- lib/fill.ts's
 * header says why: a dense 1..N series is covered by any other long series -- and a title match alone
 * cannot either, because the fill scan's `contains` tier is exactly what a sequel or a spin-off shares with
 * its parent: "Tokyo Ghoul:re" contains "Tokyo Ghoul", "My Hero Academia" is inside "My Hero Academia:
 * Vigilantes", and each lists every number the other does. Followed, the next sweep would file the
 * sequel's chapters 21.. under the parent's title, which is the wrong-book hazard the whole of lib/fill.ts
 * exists to make hard. So the numbering is asked BOTH ways unless the titles are exactly equal and the
 * primary lists enough to be sure of (judgeCandidate says the rule in full); `title_differs` and
 * `numbering_differs` are the refusals that keep it so.
 *
 * Coverage is measured against the primary's LISTING (`series_listing`, written by the add), not against
 * `lib_books`: a fresh add holds nothing on disk, and a nothing-yet add never will until the sweep. The
 * fill scan's MIN_HAVE floor applies to that listing for the fill scan's reason -- two numbers prove
 * nothing, any long series covers them.
 *
 * Nothing here searches. The candidates are the pairs the add dialog already found, so an add costs at most
 * two calls per candidate (getSeries + listChapters), under the fill scan's concurrency slots and a total
 * wall budget; a candidate that never got its turn is `not_tried`, never "listed no chapters". The result
 * lands on the add's job card (routes/sources.ts) rather than on the add's answer, because on the download
 * path the listing -- and the row -- exist only after the first chapter lands, long after the dialog was
 * answered; the dialog polls the card anyway.

 * made us:
 *
 * - An EXACT title match, when the primary lists at least ONE_WAY_MIN_LISTED numbers, is judged one way:
 *   the candidate must list at least MIN_COVERAGE of the primary's numbers (`followable`, the manual
 *   route's rule). A candidate that runs on past us is fine here -- "Followed Tale" 1..400 for our
 *   "Followed Tale" 1..20 is the same book, further along, and following it is the point.
 * - Otherwise -- a `contains` match, or an exact one on a primary listing fewer than ONE_WAY_MIN_LISTED --
 *   it is judged BOTH ways: the candidate must list at least MIN_COVERAGE of the primary's numbers AND the
 *   primary must list at least MIN_COVERAGE of the candidate's, or it is `numbering_differs`. This is the
 *   sequel guard. "Tokyo Ghoul:re" 1..60 lists all of "Tokyo Ghoul" 1..20 but we list a third of it;
 *   "My Hero Academia" 1..400 covers "My Hero Academia: Vigilantes" 1..15 forty times over; a same-named
 *   300-chapter work covers a 3-number listing entirely -- none of the three is this book, and each is
 *   refused. "Followed Tale (Official)" 1..22 for 1..20 still follows: 20 of 22 is 0.91.
 *   The reported `coverage` is then the lower of the two shares, so the person sees the number that
 *   decided.
 *
 * `prefs` and `health` are passed in by autoFollow so a whole add reads them once; a standalone call
 * reads its own. The two lookups run in parallel under ONE budget -- the larger of the two, bounded --
 * and any throw or timeout is `unreachable`: routes/sources.ts's seriesAndChapters swallows both into
 * null/[] for its own reasons, which is exactly what would make a source that did not answer read as

/**
 * The follow itself: one transaction, the series row locked, the INSERT conditional on the count.
 * Exported (as `followJudged`, v0.40.0) for the source hunt, which judges one candidate at a time with the
 * same `judgeCandidate` and must write the row under the same cap and the same lock.
 *
 * The count excludes the candidate's own source so a re-follow is an update and not a `cap`; `added_by`
 * is NULL -- the automatic path's signature (seriesSources.ts `auto`) -- unless `addedBy` names the admin who
 * asked for it (v0.49.1, Find other sources: a person started that run, so the sheet reads it as their follow),
 * and the COALESCE keeps a human's choice where one already stands. Reintroduce by dropping the
 * `WHERE (SELECT count(*) …)` clause: "the
 * third good candidate reads cap" in autoFollow.int.test.ts counts three rows, and the racing test six
 * follows. The `FOR UPDATE` is belt to that brace: without it two adds whose INSERTs evaluate the count
 * in the same instant could both pass it (READ COMMITTED sees neither's row yet). That window is
 * microseconds wide -- the racing test does not open it, and passes with the lock removed -- so the lock
 * is here for the day the window is hit, not because a test says so.
