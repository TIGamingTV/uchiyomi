// "Fetch newest" over many series at once: the Library page's select bar, one detached job.
//
// Per series it takes the newest LISTED release if we do not hold it, and nothing else (the rule lives in
// updateSeries's `newestOnly`, with the trap it avoids). What this module owns is everything a bulk action
// over up to 500 series needs that a single request cannot give:
//
// - It is DETACHED. Awaiting up to 500 listings and downloads inside one HTTP request meets the reverse
//   proxy's timeout first; the person sees "could not fetch" while the server keeps downloading, and a
//   re-click starts a second loop on top of the first. The route starts this and answers 202; the page
//   polls `bulkNewestState()`. One at a time: a second start while one runs is refused, never queued.
// - It PACES like the sweep (runUpdateAll's 1500 ms between series): the fan-out is the same shape, and
//   an unpaced burst against one site is what earned this install its 75-minute cooldowns.
// - It SCANS once at the end, then stamps dates and provenance onto the rows the scan minted (the sweep's
//   own order). A downloaded file is only a file until a scan makes it a book; the single-series "Check"
//   route learned this the hard way, and PR #53 re-learned it.
// - It STOPS on SIGTERM between series (runtime.stopping, the sweep's rule) and marks the rest skipped,
//   so a `docker compose up -d` mid-run ends at a chapter boundary with the status saying so, rather than
//   with a job card polling a dead run.
// - It is VISIBLE to the other writers: the folder it is inside is in `busyFolders`, which jobBusy in
//   routes/sources.ts reads, so a series-page Fetch or an admin refetch on that series is refused (409
//   busy) for as long as this run is on it, instead of a second job downloading the same chapter onto
//   the same path.
//
// State is in-memory, like the single-series checks and the download strip: a restart forgets it, and the
// page's poll reads `running: false` with whatever finished before the restart.
