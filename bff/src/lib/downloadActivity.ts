 * Every chapter this server downloads, whatever started it -- so a person can see what is coming in.
 *
 * The downloads pill only ever knew the jobs a button started (an add from Discover, a Fetch). Everything else
 * that brings chapters in was invisible: a source followed from "Find missing chapters" downloads at the
 * series' next check, the nightly sweep downloads for every series, Check now, the repair, a bulk "Fetch
 * newest" -- all through updateSeries or the repair, none of it through a job. Recording at `downloadChapter`
 * (lib/downloader.ts), the one function every path ends in, is what makes this complete by construction
 * rather than by remembering to register each new path.
 *
 * What started it travels in an AsyncLocalStorage (`withOrigin`) set at each entry point, so no signature
 * between the button and the downloader has to carry it. A download with no origin set says `server`.
 *
 * In memory, a day deep: what is downloading now and what came in since yesterday. What was added over a
 * longer stretch is the Updates page's job, which reads the library itself. Since v0.49.0 what finished is
 * also written down (lib/activityLog.ts) and read back at boot, so a restart -- every release is one -- no
 * longer empties the day: the listener below is how, and this module itself still never touches the database.
