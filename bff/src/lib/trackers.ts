// Push reading progress to external trackers (AniList, MyAnimeList, Kitsu).
//
// Design constraints that shaped this:
//  * Reading must never wait on, or fail because of, a tracker. Every push is fire-and-forget, rate-limited,
//    and swallows its errors into `user_trackers.last_error` for the UI to show.
//  * AniList tokens last a year and there are NO refresh tokens. Silent expiry is the failure mode users
//    hate most, so expiry is stored and surfaced, and an auth failure disables the connection loudly.
//  * `provider` is carried everywhere so MAL/Kitsu could be added without a migration. They since were, and
//    that held: no schema changed. What was NOT abstracted was the calls that talk to a service, which now
//    live in trackerProviders.ts behind one adapter each (prove a token, push progress, read the list).
//  * A user may connect SEVERAL trackers at once, so every push fans out over their enabled connections.
//    One failing service must not stop the others, and each keeps its own error and its own high-water mark.
