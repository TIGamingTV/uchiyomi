// Finding a source for a chapter the followed ones could not serve, and following it.
//
// The owner's ask: "find a source automatically with full pages and continue". The add-time auto-follow
// (lib/autoFollow.ts) never searches -- its candidates are the pairs the dialog already found -- and the
// sweep had no way to reach a source the series does not follow, so a chapter whose every followed copy
// was broken stayed broken. This module is the one place the server searches on its own initiative, and
// because every search is a real request to a site, it is bounded on every axis at once:
//
//   - the admin switch (`server_settings.auto_follow_on_failure`, on by default);
//   - once per series per HUNT_COOLDOWN_MS, stamped on `lib_series.source_hunt_at` BEFORE the search, so a
//     crash mid-hunt never re-hunts the same series every sweep;
//   - at most HUNT_MAX_PER_SWEEP hunts per sweep (the caller's `budget`), HUNT_MAX_SOURCES searched per
//     hunt, under the fill scan's concurrency slots and a HUNT_WALL_MS wall;
//   - never past MAX_FOLLOWERS, never a source the series already follows, never one that is disabled,
//     in a cooldown, or outside the caller's `allowed` rule -- for the sweep, that rule is "no adult source
//     on a clean series": a server-initiated follow must not attach one where no person would have.
//
// The identity judgement is autoFollow's `judgeCandidate`, unchanged: the candidate's own title must be
// ours and its numbering must line up, both ways unless the title is exact on a listing of at least ten.
// "Tokyo Ghoul:re" is still refused for "Tokyo Ghoul". The follow is `followJudged`, the same atomic
// write under the same cap, and the copy of the wanted number comes out of the chapter list the judgement
// already fetched (`Judgement.chapters`) -- so a hunt costs one search per candidate and two lookups per
// candidate judged, and nothing more.
//
// Since v0.41.0 the search and the follow are two calls, because the nightly repair (lib/repair.ts) wants
// a candidate for a different reason than the sweep does: `huntCandidates` runs the bounded search and
// judges candidates until the caller's `wants()` accepts one (the sweep wants "lists this number"; the gap
// step wants "brackets this hole"), and `followHunted` writes the follow and its audit row with the
// caller's `reason`. `huntSource` is the two of them composed the way the sweep always used them.
