   * Every genre with how much of THIS viewer's library sits in it, plus the covers to build a tile from.
   *
   * The browse page had genre NAMES and nothing else, so it painted them with six stock images shared
   * between forty genre names: on the real library the same night-market photo appears under Comedy,
   * Cooking, Historical, Music, School Life, Slice of Life and Sports, and fifty-six genres including the
   * second-largest one get no image at all and render as a near-black rectangle. Covers from the viewer's
   * own library cannot repeat like that and cannot be wrong, because they ARE the thing behind the label.
   *
   * Everything comes from seriesSrc, so the override-aware genre list, the soft-delete rule, per-library
   * access and the age cap all apply by construction: a viewer restricted to one library sees counts for
   * that library alone, and a genre that exists only in what they cannot open does not appear at all. A
   * count is a disclosure -- "Horror (12)" says twelve horror series exist somewhere -- so this mattering
   * is the reason it is not a separate query.
   *
   * GROUPED CASE-INSENSITIVELY, because `condSql` already filters genres with `lower(g) = lower($n)`.
   * "Slice of life" and "Slice of Life" are one filter, so they must be one tile, or the tile promises a
   * number the grid behind it does not deliver. For the same reason the count is over distinct series
   * rather than over rows: a series carrying both spellings would otherwise be counted twice.
