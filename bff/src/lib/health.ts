// Library health checks.
//
// The point of this file is to tell the operator about problems they would otherwise only discover by
// opening a chapter and finding it broken. Every check here was written against the real library and
// tuned until it stopped producing false positives, because a health page that cries wolf gets ignored
// and is worse than no health page at all.
//
// Two traps found while building it, both preserved as comments where they bite:
//  * `lib_books.pages` is filled in lazily on first read, so "pages = 0" means "never opened", not "broken".
//  * decimal chapters (12.5, 44.6) are overwhelmingly legitimate side-stories and "Notice!" pages, which are
//    genuinely one image long. Only whole-numbered chapters are worth flagging as too short.
