// The sources a series is read from: the primary pair on lib_series, then the extras in series_sources.

// One shape for both, because the series page and the follow/unfollow routes have to agree on it -- the
// page seeds its list from GET /api/series/:id and replaces it with what the admin route returns after a
// change, and two hand-written versions of "primary first, then the followers" would drift the first time
// one gained a field. The primary is a row on lib_series and not on series_sources on purpose: everything
// that routes a series (updater, fill, "check for new") reads source_id there. It moves in exactly one place,
// lib/mainSource.ts (v0.54.0): Make main and the Replace run, which swap a follower's row with the pair.
