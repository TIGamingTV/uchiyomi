// The other names a series goes by, and the one rule for when two names are the same name (v0.49.1).
//
// The idea, the name list and the parsing are @TIGamingTV's (PR #119), rebuilt on the server's own parts.
//
// A series is stored under ONE title. The same manhwa is "Solo Leveling" on one site, "Only I Level Up" on a
// second and "Na Honjaman Level Up" on a third, and a search for the first finds nothing on the other two. Most
// sources list the other names in their own description ("Alternative Titles: …", "Associated Names: …"), and a
// tracker import brings its synonyms (import_candidates.alt_titles), so the names are there to be kept: this
// file reads them, keeps them (series_alt_titles, migrate.ts) and hands them to every search that looks for a
// series on another source -- the Find other sources run (lib/findSources.ts), the add-time auto-follow and the
// nightly hunt (lib/autoFollow.ts, lib/sourceHunt.ts), borrowed chapter names (lib/borrowNames.ts) and the fill
// scan (routes/sources.ts).
//
// ⚠️ THE RULE IS EXACT. An other name matches when its normalised key EQUALS the candidate's -- never when one
// contains the other, never by word overlap. A containment is what a sequel shares with its parent ("Tokyo
// Ghoul:re" / "Tokyo Ghoul"), and other-name lists are exactly where spin-offs, the novel and the anime are listed
// beside the manhwa. A match through an other name is also held to the numbering check both ways (autoFollow.ts
// judgeCandidate), because an exact name is still only a name.
//
// Latin script only. Every other script normalises to the empty string under normTitle (letters and digits
// a-z0-9), so a Korean or Japanese name could never be compared anyway -- and an empty key must never be allowed
// to equal another empty key.
