/**
 * Finding the chapters a series is missing, and deciding who may supply them.
 *
 * The engine fix in v0.11.3 covered the common cause of a short series (a source listing only its newest
 * fifty). This covers the rest: a source that genuinely does not have the early chapters, where the only way
 * to complete the series is to take them from a different one.
 *
 * That is a far more dangerous operation than it looks. `downloadChapter` names its output purely from the
 * chapter number -- `Chapter 47.cbz` -- so a chapter fetched from the wrong series lands exactly where the
 * right one should be, is indistinguishable from it in every listing, and is only discovered by opening it.
 * Everything here exists to make that hard: the pure decisions live in this file so they can be tested
 * without a network, every refusal has a name that is shown to the person rather than swallowed, and no
 * candidate is ever filled from without a human confirming which source and which title they picked.
 *
 * The honest limit, stated here because it should not be discovered later: no rule that looks only at
 * chapter numbers can tell "the same series" from "a different series whose numbering happens to overlap".
 * A dense 1..N library is covered by any other long series. The gates below drop the obviously wrong and
 * catch renumbering; they do not prove identity, and that is exactly why the confirmation step is mandatory
 * rather than a convenience.
