/**
 * Name a chapter from ANOTHER source, when its own source only ever says "Chapter 12" (#85, @Squeaks72's idea,
 * rebuilt on the hunt's own parts).
 *
 * Plenty of sources publish no chapter titles at all while another has had "Romance Dawn" all along; the names
 * are the same work's names. ⚠️ THE HAZARD IS NUMBERING: past the point where two sources number a work
 * differently -- a side story counted, a chapter split -- every borrowed name is wrong, and wrong in the worst
 * way, because a plausible title is exactly what someone picks the next chapter by. So a donor must pass the
 * same identity judgement a source must pass before the server will FOLLOW it (autoFollow's judgeCandidate):
 * its own title is ours, and its numbering lines up both ways unless the title is exact on a long listing --
 * the rule that refuses "Tokyo Ghoul:re" for "Tokyo Ghoul". Names are then taken by EXACT number, never by a
 * floor, and only in the series' own language.
 *
 * What the first version got wrong, and this does not:
 *   - it searched through searchAll, which reports slow and failing sources to source health, so a lookup for
 *     names could put a series' own source into a cooldown and stop real downloads. Nothing here reports:
 *     each search and lookup is bounded and a failure is just a source that did not answer, as in the hunt;
 *   - donors were not filtered by the adult rule or by language (a Spanish "One Piece" matched, and named
 *     the chapters in Spanish); here the hunt's `sweepAllowedFor` applies, sources in another language are
 *     never asked, and a multi-language donor's chapters in another language are never used;
 *   - it had no search budget and trusted a remembered donor the admin had since disabled; here it is a
 *     nightly repair step with its own small budget, and a remembered donor is re-judged like any other.
 *
 * Everything it writes is marked: `lib_books.chapter_name_source` names the donor, the chapter's own source
 * always wins (seriesListing.ts's heal and library.ts setBookMeta replace a borrowed name with an own one), it
 * never writes `title`, and switching it off takes back exactly what it wrote. Off by default, per server and
 * per series, because it is traffic to sources that carry nothing else for you.
