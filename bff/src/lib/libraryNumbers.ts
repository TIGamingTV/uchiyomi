// The chapter numbers a series HOLDS -- one definition, for everything that reasons about what is missing.
//
// Four places asked this question and three of them got it wrong in a different way. The Health page's gap
// check and its impossible-number check both read `lib_books.number` raw: an admin who renumbered a chapter
// through the series page still saw the old number reported as an outlier, and a chapter they deliberately
// deleted still counted as a hole the page told them to fill. The fill dialog's scan read every row
// including tombstones, so "find missing chapters" offered nothing for a series whose gap was a deleted
// chapter -- while the Health page next door insisted the gap was there.
//
// Two rules, and both of them are somebody else's rule quoted rather than restated:
//
//   - `book_overrides.number` wins over `lib_books.number`. The raw number is DERIVED from the filename by
//     the row's name rule (lib/naming.ts numberByRule; the book_overrides note in lib/migrate.ts), and the
//     override is the manual escape hatch for when that parse is wrong. A renumber that the rest of the product honours but this query
//     does not is a finding that cannot be cleared.
//   - `heldBooks()` (lib/chapterCleanup.ts) decides what a tombstone means. A cleanup or Delete-files
//     tombstone is HELD -- the bytes went on purpose and the sweep must not fetch them back every night,
//     so it is not a gap either. A 'missing' tombstone the verify task wrote is NOT held: that file went
//     without anyone deciding so, and fetching it again is the whole point.
//
// And one that is not about a book at all (v0.49.0, #116): a series numbered by posting order keeps the number of
// a post its source DELETED as a hole (series_post_numbers.gone_at), so nothing after it moves. Nothing can fill
// that hole -- the post is gone, and no other site's numbers line up with posting order -- so it counts as held:
// a gap on the Health page and a search for the repair would be a finding nobody could ever clear.
//
// And one more of that kind (v0.55.2, #147): a notice chapter the admin hides (lib/noticeChapters.ts) that only the
// sources list. The sweep does not fetch it on purpose, so it is never held -- and a chapter that exists only in short
// parts (1.1 ... 1.9, each a few pages) left a whole-number hole at 1 that every sweep "would fetch" and none ever did.
// Counted as held, it is what it would be with the switch off, when the sweep fetches it: a chapter of the series.
//
// And one about a file (v0.55.2, #150): a file holding a range of chapters, `Batman 01-07`, holds every whole number
// from its start to its end (lib/chapterRanges.ts), so a hand-collected 01-07 never reads as six missing chapters.
//
// The SELECT is exported as well as the helper because the repair reads it per series inside a loop that
// already holds the row, and because a caller joining it into a larger query must get the same rules rather
// than a hand-written copy of them.

/**
 * The held numbers of ONE series, as SQL. `$1` is the series id; the alias is the books table's, so a
 * caller can slot it beside its own joins. `::float8` because `lib_books.number` is `real` and the pg
 * driver hands a `real` back as a JS number only through a float8 cast -- a half-chapter 12.5 read as
 * `12.5` here and as `12.5000019` after a round trip through `real` is the kind of difference that makes
 * gapsOf disagree with itself.
 * Reintroduce the books alone (drop the UNION): "a post the source deleted is a hole, not a gap" in
 * health.int.test.ts reads the hole as a gap.
 * The second branch is each range's whole numbers after its start, which the first already gives: `01-07` is 1, then
 * 2 to 7. Reintroduce by dropping it: "a file holding chapters 1 to 7 is no gap" in chapterRanges.int.test.ts finds
 * a gap of six.
 * The last part, the hidden notices only the sources list, exists only while something hides (lib/noticeChapters.ts
 * `active`); reintroduce by dropping it: "a chapter that exists only in short parts" in noticeChapters.int.test.ts
 * finds a gap at 1, and Fill now leaves it for a sweep that never comes.
