// Which library each series is in when a library's folders change: creating, re-pathing or removing one (v0.55.1, #148).
//
// A scan never moves a series it already knows (lib/library.ts persistScan keeps an existing row in its library, so it
// can never re-mint an id by recomputing), so a library save is where its series move, in the save's own transaction.
// One rule for all three: every series that is not pinned and sits under any folder the library held before the save
// or holds after it goes to the library holding the longest folder its own folder is in, across every library's
// folders -- the rule libraryIdFor applies to a new folder -- or to the default library when none holds it. Removing a
// library also moves what it still holds by hand: nothing may point at a library that is gone.
//
// The preview runs the same statement and stops short of the UPDATE, so the count it promises is what the save does.
