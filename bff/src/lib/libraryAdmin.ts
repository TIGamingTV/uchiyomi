// Destructive library operations: hide a series, restore it, and merge one into another.
//
// Deleting HIDES rather than erases. The id survives, so favourites, ratings, notes and -- above all --
// reading history stay attached to something real, the action is undoable, and we never have to choose
// between erasing someone's reading events (which silently rewrites their stats, streaks and Wrapped) and
// leaving a dead series in Trending. persistScan() knows to skip a hidden folder, or the next scan would
// simply bring it back under a new id.
//
// Merging does NOT de-duplicate chapters, deliberately. Every chapter row and every progress row survives
// exactly as it is. The moment you delete a chapter because it looks like a duplicate, you have to fold two
// read_progress rows into one, and getting that wrong silently marks chapters unread -- which then syncs
// outward to the user's AniList account and cannot be undone. Duplicate chapter numbers are a tidiness
// problem the health page can surface; lost reading progress is not recoverable.

// ---- forget ----

// The third step, after Remove (hides, undoable) and Delete files (the bytes go, the rows and everyone's
// history stay). Forget is the only code path in the app that hard-deletes a series row, and with it the
// only one that erases reading history across users: progress, events, bookmarks, notes, ratings,
// favourites, tracker floors. That retroactively rewrites stats, streaks, the leaderboard and Wrapped for
// everyone who read it, which is why it is a separate, typed-confirmation step and never a shortcut.
//
// Two invariants the preconditions protect:
//   1. Nothing forgotten may come back. persistScan skips a folder only while a deleted_at / merged_into row
//      exists for it (lib/library.ts), so once the row is gone any folder still on disk is rescanned as a
//      brand-new series under a new id -- with no history, next to the history that was just erased. So
//      the folder must be absent on every root, and no chapter row may still claim a file.
//   2. Nothing that lives on may be erased. After a merge the absorbed row's chapters belong to the survivor,
//      while rows keyed by (book, series) can still carry the absorbed series_id (older merges left
//      bookmarks and tracker floors behind; an offline outbox replays whatever series_id the phone had). Every
//      per-user table is therefore re-pointed to the book's CURRENT series before anything is deleted, deletes
//      are keyed on the book ids this series actually owns, and an assertion refuses the whole transaction if
//      a progress row or bookmark on someone else's chapter is still filed here.

 * so an empty directory cannot be rescanned into a series. Delete files unlinks every chapter and then
 * rm's the folder, but a merge survivor's Delete files ran the per-book loop over the absorbed row's files
 * (they moved to the survivor) while only rm'ing the survivor's folder, and the absorbed folder -- empty --
 * refused Forget forever with the Delete files chip already hidden (R3's probe P2). Both ends are fixed:
 * deleteSeriesFiles rm's the absorbed folders too, and this check ignores a folder with no chapters.
 * Reintroduce by refusing on `realpath` alone: "forget of a survivor after Delete files is not refused on
 * the absorbed row's empty folder" in forgetSeries.int.test.ts reads folder_present.
 *
 * Rows this series absorbed (`merged_into = id`) go with it in the same transaction, under the same rules.

 * them as held so nothing was ever fetched again, and a second Delete files reported "Deleted N file(s)"
 * for rows it had not touched (`files` counted rows, not unlinks). With the mark, a series put back after
 * this shows its chapters as "Deleted from the server", which is the truth, and Fetch again works on them.
 *
 * ⚠️ A ROW WHOSE FILE IS ALREADY ABSENT IS RECONCILED ONLY UNDER PROOF THAT THE ROOT IS MOUNTED. On an
 * unmounted share every stat fails and every file is fine on the disk that is not there, and "Delete files"
 * must not turn that into a library of tombstones -- but a series whose folder the admin rm -rf'd on the NAS
 * (#55's own scenario) has live rows and no files, nothing else in the app ever marks a read-library row,
 * and until v0.38.0's fix pass it could never be forgotten: Delete files did nothing, the Removed row never
 * offered Forget, and the route said "2 chapter files are still on disk" while nothing was (R3's probe P11).
 * The proof is the verify task's own (lib/verifyFiles.ts, the whole-batch rule): a root is mounted when
 * stat(root) works AND at least one chapter file of ANY series is present under it -- a present file, never
 * a folder, because the downloader mkdir -p's series folders on a bare mount point -- and not when more than
 * nine looked-at rows in ten have no file, verify's 90 % rule against the one stray download that landed in
 * the overlay while the share was down. The rows this series has on the root are what we stat anyway; when
 * none of them is present, up to `PROOF_SAMPLE` live rows of other series on the same root are stat'ed too,
 * so a one-series scratch root can never be proven (that is the test's "empty readable root"). Under proof,
 * a live row whose file is absent is marked 'deleted', and a 'missing' tombstone (verify's mark) becomes
 * 'deleted' too -- the file is not coming back by itself and the sweep must stop trying to fetch it. On an
 * unproven root every row is left exactly as it was, which is what keeps Forget's live-row refusal standing
 * for a share that is merely not here. Reintroduce by tombstoning the absent rows without the proof (or by
 * counting a present FOLDER as proof): "Delete files on an empty readable root marks nothing" in
 * fileOps.int.test.ts finds the rows marked; "a read-library series whose folder was removed by hand can be
 * forgotten after Delete files" in forgetSeries.int.test.ts is the other half.
 *
 * ⚠️ The folders of rows merged INTO this series are removed as well. Their chapter rows moved to the
 * survivor at merge time, so the per-book loop unlinks their files, but the directories used to be left
 * standing (empty) and Forget refused on them forever with the Delete files chip already hidden (R3's probe
 * P2). Reintroduce by rm'ing `row.folder` only: "delete files removes the folder of a row merged into the
 * series" in fileOps.int.test.ts finds the absorbed directory still there.
