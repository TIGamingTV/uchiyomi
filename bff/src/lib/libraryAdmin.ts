// Merging does NOT de-duplicate chapters, deliberately. Every chapter row and every progress row survives

//   1. Nothing forgotten may come back. persistScan skips a folder only while a deleted_at / merged_into row

//      brand-new series under a new id -- with no history, next to the history that was just erased. So
//      the folder must be absent on every root, and no chapter row may still claim a file.

//      while rows keyed by (book, series) can still carry the absorbed series_id (older merges left
//      bookmarks and tracker floors behind; an offline outbox replays whatever series_id the phone had). Every

/**
 * Delete a hidden series' files from disk.
 *
 * Requires the series to be hidden already, so the reversible step always happens first: "Remove" hides,
 * and only then can you also delete the files. It is an escalation, never a shortcut past the undo.
 *
 * The chapter ROWS and everyone's read_progress stay. read_progress.book_id is ON DELETE RESTRICT precisely
 * so that removing a chapter cannot silently delete what someone read of it, which is the one loss with no
 * undo and which syncs outward to AniList. A later scan neither resurrects them (the folder is gone) nor
 * prunes them (there is no prune path).
 *
 * The rows whose file this removed are marked pruned with reason 'deleted' (tombstoneBooks, the same mark
 * the chapter-level delete leaves). Until v0.37.0 they were left as live rows claiming bytes that were
 * gone: Put back then listed every chapter as openable and each one 404'd, the updater's have-set counted
 * them as held so nothing was ever fetched again, and a second Delete files reported "Deleted N file(s)"
 * for rows it had not touched (`files` counted rows, not unlinks). With the mark, a series put back after
 * this shows its chapters as "Deleted from the server", which is the truth, and Fetch again works on them.
 *
 * ⚠️ A ROW WHOSE FILE IS ALREADY ABSENT IS RECONCILED ONLY UNDER PROOF THAT THE ROOT IS MOUNTED. On an
 * unmounted share every stat fails and every file is fine on the disk that is not there, and "Delete files"
 * must not turn that into a library of tombstones -- but a series whose folder the admin rm -rf'd on the NAS
 * (#55's own scenario) has live rows and no files, nothing else in the app ever marks a read-library row,
 * and until v0.38.0's fix pass it could never be forgotten: Delete files did nothing, the Removed row never
 * offered Forget, and the route said "2 chapter files are still on disk" while nothing was (R3's probe P11).
 * The proof is the verify task's own (lib/verifyFiles.ts, the whole-batch rule): a root is mounted when
 * stat(root) works AND at least one chapter file of ANY series is present under it -- a present file, never
 * a folder, because the downloader mkdir -p's series folders on a bare mount point -- and not when more than
 * nine looked-at rows in ten have no file, verify's 90 % rule against the one stray download that landed in
 * the overlay while the share was down. The rows this series has on the root are what we stat anyway; when
 * none of them is present, up to `PROOF_SAMPLE` live rows of other series on the same root are stat'ed too,
 * so a one-series scratch root can never be proven (that is the test's "empty readable root"). Under proof,
 * a live row whose file is absent is marked 'deleted', and a 'missing' tombstone (verify's mark) becomes
 * 'deleted' too -- the file is not coming back by itself and the sweep must stop trying to fetch it. On an
 * unproven root every row is left exactly as it was, which is what keeps Forget's live-row refusal standing
 * for a share that is merely not here. Reintroduce by tombstoning the absent rows without the proof (or by
 * counting a present FOLDER as proof): "Delete files on an empty readable root marks nothing" in
 * fileOps.int.test.ts finds the rows marked; "a read-library series whose folder was removed by hand can be
 * forgotten after Delete files" in forgetSeries.int.test.ts is the other half.
 *
 * ⚠️ The folders of rows merged INTO this series are removed as well. Their chapter rows moved to the
 * survivor at merge time, so the per-book loop unlinks their files, but the directories used to be left
 * standing (empty) and Forget refused on them forever with the Delete files chip already hidden (R3's probe
 * P2). Reintroduce by rm'ing `row.folder` only: "delete files removes the folder of a row merged into the
 * series" in fileOps.int.test.ts finds the absorbed directory still there.
