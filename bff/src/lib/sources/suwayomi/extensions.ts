 * How many extensions THIS repository put in the catalogue.

 * an extension counts when the repository it came from is none of the ones configured before the add, and it
 * was not already in the catalogue under that repository. That second clause is what keeps an installed
 * extension whose repository was removed long ago -- the engine keeps its row and its old address -- from
 * being credited to whatever is added next. Matching the address the user typed would not do: the engine
 * stores its own spelling of it (see repoKey), which is why the check is "none of the old ones" rather than
 * "this one".
 *
 * ⚠️ That orphan is OBSOLETE (the engine flags an installed extension no configured repository offers), and
 * obsolete is what is skipped -- on both sides. Skipping it in `before` only by "already seen" refused the one
 * add that brings it back: remove a repository, add it again, and every extension it offers that is still
 * installed was "already there", so a repository whose extensions were all installed yielded 0, was taken
 * back out with a 422, and its extensions stayed obsolete (no updates) for good. The engine re-attaches them
 * on the re-add (isObsolete true before, false after), so a row obsolete BEFORE is not "seen", and a row
 * still obsolete AFTER was not brought by this repository.
 *
 * An engine that names no repository per extension is judged by the catalogue growing instead. ⚠️ Never by
 * the catalogue's SIZE: until v0.45.0 a broken second repository toasted "Added — 1396 extensions" because
 * that was the first repository's count.

/**
 * A second URL worth trying when a repository yields nothing at all.

 * empty and needs a retry (the caller does that first). But repository layouts do vary, so when retries have
 * genuinely produced nothing, this offers one more thing to try:
 *
 * - `…/index.json` → the `…/index.min.json` beside it;
 * - a bare folder (`…/repo` or `…/repo/`) → `…/repo/index.min.json`, the file Mihon itself reads.
 *
 * Both point AT index.min.json because Suwayomi v2.3.2243 refuses a legacy (list-shaped) index at any address
 * that does not end in `/index.min.json` ("Provided legacy store url is not valid", only in the engine's log).
 * ⚠️ Until v0.45.0's review the alternative ran the other way, `…/index.min.json` → `…/index.json`, which that
 * rule makes impossible: every refused add spent ~2 s and two engine writes on it, and a pasted `index.json`
 * -- the one case where an alternative helps -- got none and was refused, though the index.min.json in the
 * same folder works. An index.min.json that yields nothing has no alternative.
 *
 * The caller must verify: try what the user typed, and keep this alternative ONLY if it produced something.
 * Rewriting a URL blindly would break repositories where the original form is the correct one.
