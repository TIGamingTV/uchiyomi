// Which extension languages the operator reads, and the bulk switch that acts on it.
//
// Installing an extension switches on every source it provides, and a multi-language extension provides
// one per language -- thirty sources in languages nobody in the household reads, each of them a fan-out
// target for cross-source search and a step towards the SUWAYOMI_MAX_SOURCES cap (issue #38). The fix is a
// standing instruction, not a one-off: hiding a language turns its sources off now AND keeps them off when
// the next extension is installed. The per-language rows with one Hide/Show button, rather than a source
// list to comb through, are the layout contributor PR #39 proposed.
//
// Pure database helpers. Nothing here talks to the engine, so the rule is testable without one.
