 * ⚠️ That does NOT mean the engine solves Cloudflare on its own. Suwayomi-Server is a headless JVM with no

 * integration is OFF by default -- every challenged request then throws `Cloudflare bypass currently

 * FLARESOLVERR_ENABLED / FLARESOLVERR_URL; an external engine needs the same two settings. Images do need
 * Suwayomi's auth header, which is declared via
 * `imageHeaders` rather than special-cased on the id, so the core keeps consulting capabilities not names.
 * The same goes for pacing: `pageConcurrency` and `pageGapMs` say that page URLs here are the engine's own
 * proxy paths, rate-limited by the engine towards the site, so the downloader may overlap them instead of
 * applying the one-at-a-time quarter-second gap that scraped sites need. The downloader never asks whether
