/**
 * The nightly library repair: everything the Health page could only report, done.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 *   The owner, looking at Admin -> Health on their own server: "do we have any implementations that auto
 *   fix these issues?" The page said "Suspiciously short chapters 14", "Chapter gaps 40", "Chapters that
 *   would not download 183", "Cloudflare solver: 4 sources failed inside it" -- every one of them a finding
 *   with no button behind it, several of them months old. This job is the button, run once a night.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL AND WILL NOT DO
 *   Five steps, in this order: the solver, page counts, capped download failures, short chapters, gaps.
 *   Each one is either REVERSIBLE (a stamp, a cooldown cleared, a chapter fetched) or PROVABLE (a short
 *   chapter is replaced only when another copy is measurably longer, and marked "this really is two pages"
 *   only when every copy answered and the search found nothing).
 *
 *   ⚠️ It never removes a file, never writes a tombstone, never merges two series and never renumbers a
 *   chapter. Duplicate series and impossible chapter numbers stay one-click actions an admin confirms, by
 *   decision: those four operations are the ones this project cannot undo, and a job that runs while
 *   nobody is watching must not be able to take them. A static test greps this file for the calls that
 *   would (test/repair.int.test.ts, "the nightly cannot delete, merge or renumber anything").
 *
 *   ⚠️ No container access, ever. "Restart the solver" is not available to this process and must not
 *   become available: the app can reset only what it itself remembers about the solver
 *   (resetSolverSessions) and what it wrote into source_health.
 *
 * LOAD
 *   Every step is bounded by a named constant or a documented environment knob, and several steps cost no
 *   network call at all. Per run, at most: REPAIR_COUNT_MAX archives opened on our own disk; one listing
 *   refresh plus at most REPAIR_SHORT_COPIES page lists (one per SOURCE), one search and one download for
 *   each of at most REPAIR_SHORT_MAX short chapters; one search and REPAIR_GAP_CHAPTERS downloads for each
 *   of at most REPAIR_GAPS_MAX series; REPAIR_HUNT_BUDGET searches for the whole run, shared between the
 *   steps but with at most REPAIR_SHORT_HUNT_MAX of them spendable by the short step, so the two hunting
 *   steps cannot starve each other. Every "checked" stamp is written BEFORE the network call it describes,
 *   so a crash mid-step never makes the same series the first thing tomorrow's run does again -- and a
 *   step with no searches left stops rather than stamp a series it cannot search.
 *
 * It is DETACHED from its route, like the sweep, the cleanup and the verify: the work is minutes, and a
 * request that long dies at the reverse proxy while the job keeps going. The route answers `started` with
 * the run's id, the Health page polls GET /api/admin/tasks/repair/status (fed by `repairState.live`, the one
 * object every step reports into), and every run -- nightly or pressed -- is kept in repair_runs
 * (lib/repairRuns.ts). ⚠️ Only a FULL run (no `only`) writes `repairState.lastResult` and
 * server_settings.repair_last_run / repair_last_result: those are the Tasks line and the nightly's schedule,
 * and a one-row Fix pressed at 23:00 used to replace the first and move the second (v0.49.0).

 * what escalates the NEXT cooldown from 15 minutes to 75. A day of quiet should reset that escalation.

 * nightly would hand it a clean slate a few hours before it earns the same block again.

 * from whoever had it, and when the preferred group's copy turned up a day later it was never looked at
 * again, because what is on disk is never replaced by the sweep. This step is that second look. @Squeaks72's
 * #93 tried it by SOURCE; it is done here by GROUP, which is what #81 asks for, and under the rules that
 * PR's review set:
 *
 *   - OFF unless an admin switches it on (`server_settings.group_upgrade`). It replaces files on disk.
 *   - Owned files only: the download root and the downloader's own filename, as the short step (and
 *     `lib_books.source_id` is NOT that test -- setBookMeta stamps it on files in both roots).
 *   - Never a shorter copy: the preferred copy's page list is counted BEFORE anything is downloaded, and
 *     fewer pages than the file on disk means no. A one-page "chapter removed" notice from the right group
 *     is exactly what this rule is for. And never a partial copy, whatever it would beat.
 *   - Only a file whose group is KNOWN and ranks below a group the preferences name. A file with no group
 *     could already be the preferred group's, and "unranked beats unranked" would re-fetch the library.
 *   - Never a chapter someone picked a copy for by hand (`picked_at`), a deleted one, one with pages missing
 *     (the sweep's completion pass owns those), or one in a series no longer updated.
 *   - The busy-folder hold, a listing refresh first, and a series is skipped when it did not answer.
 *   - REPAIR_GROUPS_MAX downloads a night; a chapter whose attempt failed waits GROUP_RETRY_DAYS.
 *   - restampBook afterwards, so pages, source and group describe the new file, and an audit row per swap.
 *
 * Reading progress and bookmarks stay, as with the short step: the file is written over the same row.
