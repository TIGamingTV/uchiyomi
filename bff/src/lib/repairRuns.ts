/**
 * Every library repair run, kept: the nightly and every Health press alike (v0.49.0).
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 *   Until v0.49.0 a run left one trace besides the audit row: server_settings.repair_last_run and
 *   repair_last_result, written by EVERY run. A one-row "Fix" pressed at 23:00 therefore replaced the
 *   nightly's result on the Tasks line with "0 counted, 1 short looked at" -- and, because server.ts arms the
 *   first nightly after a restart from repair_last_run, it moved the nightly's schedule as well. Now only a
 *   FULL run (no `only`) writes those two columns, and every run, full or scoped, gets a row here, which is
 *   what the Health page reads for "Recent repairs", "last repair on this card" and "usually about 4 min".
 *
 *   The audit rows stay exactly as they were, for Activity. They carry only a summary string -- no timing,
 *   no skip reasons, and the nightly and a test both audit with a null user -- so they are not a history.
 *
 * ⚠️ This module holds the history's only DELETE (the prune), and it touches repair_runs alone.
 *   lib/repair.ts may not contain a DELETE at all: "the nightly cannot delete, merge or renumber anything"
 *   in repair.int.test.ts greps it, and extends the same scan to this file with a narrower rule.
 * ⚠️ Best effort, every call: history must never be the thing that fails a repair. Each writer catches and
 *   logs, exactly as logAudit and the failure ledger do.
