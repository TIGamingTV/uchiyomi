/**
 * "Rescan everything" (v0.55.4, discussion #150): the chapters whose files are gone from your own folders, found and
 * shown first, then marked on Apply.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 *   @Kedryn on #150: "What if I want to rescan everything from scratch, removing from library what is no more on
 *   disk?" He keeps hand-collected US and IT comics in a library of his own, and a scan never removes anything:
 *   persistScan only inserts or updates the files it finds (lib/library.ts), so a chapter whose file he deleted,
 *   moved out or renamed stays live for good -- listed, counted, opening onto "Chapter deleted". Verify chapter files
 *   (lib/verifyFiles.ts) finds those as well, and marks only the download folder's, for the sweep to fetch again:
 *   a file in a library you built by hand is counted and left, because Uchiyomi cannot fetch it back.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 *   The preview (startRescan, detached like Verify): one scan first, so every file on disk has its row and a renamed
 *   file is the new row it will be; then one stat per live row's OWN file, root by root -- never the series folder,
 *   because a merge survivor's rows sit in the folder it absorbed; then a plan, kept in memory with its id and its
 *   time, saying what Apply would do. Nothing in the plan is changed by the preview.
 *   Apply (startApply, detached too): refused for a stale plan and beside any job that changes the library, then,
 *   with every scan held off (withScansHeld), each planned row is asked again -- the same id at the same file, still
 *   live, its series still looked at, its file still not there, its fingerprint still no live row's -- and marked
 *   pruned with reason 'deleted' (tombstoneBooks), the mark Delete files leaves on a file it removed: HELD, so the
 *   sweep never fetches it back, and "File no longer on disk" on the series page. Then the cover and the counts of
 *   every series it touched, an audit entry, and the result, kept in server_settings for the Tasks line.
 *
 * ⚠️ A ROW IS NEVER ERASED. read_progress.book_id is ON DELETE RESTRICT and the row IS everyone's reading history of
 *   the chapter; erasing it would also turn its number into a ghost the sweep downloads again (lib/komgaGhosts.ts),
 *   and flip a tracker's "finished" (trackers.ts counts every row). The tombstone keeps all of it, and a file that
 *   comes back is picked up again: the scan clears the mark on the same row (lib/library.ts persistScan).
 *   Reintroduce by erasing the rows: "Apply marks your own folder's gone chapters and nothing else" finds rows gone.
 *
 * ⚠️ ONLY YOUR OWN LIBRARY FOLDER IS MARKED (LIBRARY_ROOT). The download folder's gone rows are Verify chapter
 *   files' to mark 'missing', the one reason the sweep fetches again onto the same rows; here they are counted, and
 *   the panel points at Verify. Rows under any other root are not a scan's, so not a rescan's. Nothing else is
 *   touched: no file on disk, no row already pruned (Verify's 'missing' above all keeps its mark), no series hidden
 *   or forgotten -- a series with nothing left is listed with a link, for the admin -- and no tracker floor, read
 *   mark, favourite or rating.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE WHOLE-ROOT RULES, PER ROOT, ARE VERIFY'S (lib/verifyFiles.ts says why at length). An unmounted share is an
 *   empty, readable mount point, and from in here it looks exactly like a library whose every file is gone: a root
 *   where no looked-at row's FILE is present (a folder is no proof -- the downloader creates folders on a bare mount
 *   point), or that cannot be read, plans nothing and is reported; and so is a root where more than nine rows in ten
 *   have no file, with the share in the entry, so one stray file cannot turn "unmounted" into "mark the rest".
 *   Reintroduce by dropping the present-file test: "an empty library folder looks unmounted and plans nothing" in
 *   rescan.int.test.ts finds the root reported by the 90 % rule instead (the second net over the same hole); by
 *   dropping REFUSE_ABOVE: "a folder with almost every file gone is refused, with the share of it" finds the rows
 *   planned.
 *
 * ⚠️ ONLY "NOT THERE" IS GONE. Verify reads any failed stat as a missing file. Here only ENOENT and ENOTDIR are: a
 *   folder the server may not read (EACCES), a NAS that answers with an I/O error or a stale handle, says nothing
 *   about whether the file is there, and a plan built on it would mark files that are fine. Those rows are counted
 *   as `unchecked` and left out of both whole-root rules. Reintroduce by reading every failed stat as gone: "a file
 *   that cannot be checked is not a gone file" finds the unreadable folder's chapters planned.
 *
 * ⚠️ MOVED OR RENAMED IS PAIRED BEFORE ANYTHING IS MARKED. A file renamed in place, or moved into another folder,
 *   is a new row to the scan (rows are keyed on (root, file)) and its old row reads as gone. That old row holds the
 *   chapter's whole reading history, so a gone row whose fingerprint (lib/fingerprint.ts, the archive's own entry
 *   table) matches a live row's is "moved or renamed" and KEPT, never planned. It has to happen before any mark: a
 *   tombstone forgets its fingerprint (tombstoneBooks). The scan has just made the new row, and the background
 *   backfill has not reached it yet, so the live rows that were never fingerprinted are fingerprinted here, newest
 *   first, at most PAIR_MAX per preview. Reintroduce by planning every gone row: "a moved or renamed file is paired
 *   before anything is planned" finds the renamed chapter's old row in the plan.
 *
 * ⚠️ APPLY LOOKS AGAIN, UNDER THE SCAN HOLD. Minutes can pass between the preview and the press: a file comes back,
 *   a renumber or a rename moves a row to another file, Verify or a cleanup marks one, a share is unmounted. So a
 *   planned row is marked only if it is still the row that was looked at and its file is still not there, the folder
 *   still holds the files the preview saw (`samples`), and no live row has its fingerprint by now. With scans held,
 *   no scan can bring a row back between the look and the mark. Reintroduce by marking the plan as it stands: "Apply
 *   asks every row again, with scans held" finds the file that came back marked.
 *
 * ⚠️ ONE WRITER PER SERIES, AS A RENUMBER HAS IT. A series something is writing into or checking as Apply reaches it --
 *   a Fetch (several chapters at once since v0.55.4, a lane per image server), the slow archive's chapter, Fetch newest,
 *   a repair, a check reading its listing -- is left alone and counted (`busy`), for the next Rescan: those writers chose
 *   their chapters by the numbers the series has now, and the opt-in is about to change them. Every other series the
 *   Apply changes is held busy until it is done (bulkNewest's busyFolders, the one mark all of them honour), so none of
 *   them starts in it meanwhile: a Fetch is refused as busy (and one that took the folder just before waits, routes/
 *   sources.ts startDownloadJob), the archive waits its turn (`series_busy`). The test and the mark are one turn, with
 *   no await between them, as the archive's own (lib/archive.ts begin). Reintroduce by dropping the test: "a series
 *   being downloaded into is left alone at Apply" in rescan.int.test.ts finds its chapter marked and renumbered; by
 *   dropping the mark: the same test finds a Fetch let in.
 *
 * ⚠️ NEVER AT BOOT, NEVER ON A SCHEDULE, for Verify's reason: a boot with the share not yet mounted is the empty
 *   mount point on every start. The one caller is the admin's Tasks panel (routes/admin.ts, routes/rescan.ts).
 *   "rescan never runs at boot or on a schedule" in rescan.int.test.ts pins the callers.
 *
 * THE OPT-IN: CHAPTER NUMBERS BY THE NEWER FILE-NAME RULES (v0.55.2's rule 2, lib/naming.ts). A row is read by the rule
 *   it was first scanned with, for good -- so a library collected before v0.55.2 keeps "Vol 2 Ch 5" as chapter 2 and
 *   "Batman (1987) #12" as 1987, behind the readers' backs of nobody, because a completed chapter's number is what the
 *   trackers were told (the book_overrides note in lib/migrate.ts). Re-reading every name was refused on purpose. Here
 *   it is asked for, per series, with the cost in front of the admin: the preview lists each series whose numbers
 *   rule 2 would change (`numberByRule(name, 2)` against the stored number and range), with how many readers finished
 *   one of those chapters, how many carry a number set by hand (those keep it), and for a series linked to a tracker
 *   how many finished chapters would go up -- told next time, irreversibly -- or down, which the tracker floor
 *   refuses. A series numbered by posting order, or in the middle of a renumber, is left out: its numbers are not its
 *   file names'. Apply sets name_rule, number and number_end for the ticked series only, in one transaction under the
 *   same scan hold, writes an audit entry, and pushes NOTHING to a tracker. "From scratch" never means erase and
 *   insert again: new ids would strand every row's history, and turn every row into a rule-2 row unasked.
 *
 * It is DETACHED from its route like Verify and the sweep: a scan and one stat per chapter over a network share is
 * minutes on a large library, and a request that long dies at the reverse proxy. The route answers `started`, and
 * the Tasks panel polls GET /api/admin/tasks/rescan/status for the phase, the progress and the plan.
