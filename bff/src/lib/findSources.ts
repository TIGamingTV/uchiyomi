// Find other sources (v0.49.1): a calm, paced background job that follows other sources for many series at once --
// above all for every series whose MAIN source has stopped answering.
//
// The idea is @TIGamingTV's ("Connect sources", PR #119), rebuilt on the server's own parts after its review. Why
// now: the owner's main source, aqua (195 series), has answered only "Aqua Manga is temporarily offline" since
// 2026-09-23, six of those series followed a second source, and the rest had no way to get a chapter. Following
// another source for each by hand is a Find missing chapters scan and a confirmation, 189 times over.
//
// Everything that decides anything is reused, never copied:
//   - which series: lib/findScope.ts (the admin's selection, or every series whose main source is the one named);
//   - where to look: scanOrder over the sources the admin who started the run may reach -- their own age cap, as
//     Discover and the manual follow route read it (visibility.sourceAllowedFor), NOT the hunt's sweepAllowedFor,
//     which drops every extension that flags itself adult for a series not rated 18+: most manhwa extensions do,
//     and on a typical library every series then had no source to ask (#132) -- and in the series' language
//     (v0.52.0, #123: a source in another language than the series is never asked), with the main source excluded
//     ALWAYS (it is the one that is down) and the sources it already follows, and health read per series, so a
//     source disabled or cooling down since the run started is not asked;
//   - how to look: the hunt's non-reporting search (sourceHunt.ts searchByNames) under the hunt's shared slots,
//     the title and up to three of the series' other names (lib/altTitles.ts), an other name matched exactly. A
//     series with no other name stored is first given the ones its stored description lists, and failing that the
//     ones its main source's description lists (learnNames below): a series added before v0.49.1 has none. A
//     search that fails is a source that did not answer: it never escalates a cooldown and never marks Health
//     failing, where #115 would confirm a failure after three in a row -- and a run over many series IS many in
//     a row;
//   - whether it is this series: autoFollow's judgeCandidate, unchanged (title, then the numbering, both ways
//     unless an exact main title on a long listing; its disabled and cooldown checks);
//   - the follow: followJudged, the one atomic write under the follower cap, with the admin who started the run
//     as added_by -- a person asked for it;
//   - what may never be followed: a series numbered by posting order (lib/numbering.ts, #116), whose followers are
//     never merged; a series already at the cap.
//
// Its manners are the slow archive's and bulk Fetch newest's: one run at a time, 1.5 s between the series it asks
// about, waiting while a sweep, a repair or the daily source check runs, stopping at a series boundary on shutdown
// or when an admin says stop. Per series it stops asking once the free follower slots are filled or three
// sources carry the title (the fill scan's three-source stop), and gives up after a wall; what a stop, the wall or
// a restart cut short is `not_tried` -- never "not found" -- and every other outcome says what it was (FindWhy).
//
// When it ends, every series that gained a follower gets a listing refresh (updateSeries with nothing to download,
// the follow route's own), 1.5 s apart in the background, so the new source's chapters show on the series page
// and the sweep takes them from there, without a burst. The run is kept in source_find_runs (newest 20), so the
// result outlives the tab and a restart. A shutdown gives the run a moment to close its own row (server.ts,
// findSettledWithin); a row still `running` after a restart is closed as `interrupted` all the same, with every
// series it never reached listed as `not_tried`, exactly as a stopped run lists them.
//
// Review first (v0.51.0, #132; the idea is @TIGamingTV's, PR #133): a run started with `review` searches and judges
// exactly as above and follows nothing. Each series keeps the candidates the judgement would follow (green) or that
// a person should look at (amber: the chapter numbers do not line up though a name matches exactly, or it matched
// only under another name) as `proposals` in its result, with the candidate's cover, so an admin confirms each by
// eye -- TI caught a wrong match by its cover that the automatic judgement would have followed. A proposal is then
// followed (decideProposal: checked again, then followJudged under the cap) or dismissed, one at a time, and says
// which it was. The mode is kept in the run's `scope` (`review: true`): no column, so v0.50.0 boots on the same rows.
//
// Replace (v0.54.0): the same run over every series of one source, `mode: 'replace'`, MOVES them off it. The owner,
// after a full Find run left all 195 aqua series on aqua: "i have to go one by one test and find replacement
// sources". Per series (replaceFor): its best working follower becomes its main source at once (lib/replaceSource.ts
// ranks them, lib/mainSource.ts switches), with no search; a series with none is searched for as above -- its dead
// followers not counting against the cap, and dropped only as far as a follow needs the room -- and the source it
// follows first becomes its main source. Series followers-first, so the instant promotions land first; paced only
// after a series that searched. Review first proposes instead: each series' followers, or what its search found,
// with the one it would promote marked, and promoteProposal applies one. `turnOff` turns the replaced source off once
// the run ends with no series left on it (lib/retireSource.ts). The mode rides in the run's `scope` as `review` does.
