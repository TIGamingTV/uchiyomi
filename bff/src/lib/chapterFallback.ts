// One chapter, every way it can still land: the chosen copy, then the same number from another followed
// source, then a source found for the purpose, and finally the chapter with holes in it.
//
// Three loops download chapters -- the sweep (lib/updater.ts), the job card (routes/sources.ts
// startDownloadJob: fills, fetches, refetches) and the add path's detached run -- and until v0.40.0 each
// asked ONE copy and gave up. The owner's complaint was exactly that: "a missing page, like 149 of 155,
// causes the chapter not to be downloaded", and the ledger agreed with 153 rows of "N-1 of N pages" that
// the sweep re-tried every night for weeks while `series_listing.copies` (v0.33.0) knew about a second
// copy of every one of them on a followed source. This is the one helper all three loops now call, so
// the order of things to try is written down once.
//
// The order, and why it is this order:
//   1. The chosen copy. Skipped outright when its source has already refused this run (`refusing`): a
//      site that answered 403 or 429 minutes ago is not asked again, and the cooldown is the answer. And
//      when an admin has switched its source off (v0.54.0): switched off means off.
//   2. The same number from another followed source, at most MAX_ALTERNATES of them, ranked as the
//      release rules rank copies (lib/releases.ts copiesOf), minus the sources that are refusing, disabled,
//      in a cooldown, or outside the viewer's age cap. Never for a PINNED copy: a person who tapped one
//      specific version asked for that version, and "we fetched a different one" is not what they meant.
//   3. A source found for the purpose (lib/sourceHunt.ts), only when the caller offers one and only when
//      the chosen copy did not fail on a refusal: a 403 or a 429 says the site is saying no to us, and
//      following a third source because the first is rate-limiting would turn a cooldown into a load on
//      someone else. A missing page, an error, a site that is down -- those are worth a search. The one
//      exception is a refusal the caller marks `persistent` (the same site has refused this number across
//      two sweeps already): that is no longer a busy site but a chapter it will not serve, and the hunt
//      is the only way it lands. Even then a refusal never becomes a partial (step 4).
//   4. The best hold. A copy that arrived at or above PARTIAL_CHAPTER_FLOOR is offered by the downloader
//      as a PartialHold (never written by it); the hold with the fewest missing pages across everything
//      tried here is written last, once nothing landed whole. So a chapter is saved with holes only when
//      every source that could have served it whole was asked and could not.
//
// Every step is a real request to a site. The caps here (two alternates, one hunt, one write) are the
// whole of what one failed chapter may cost, and the reviewers count them.
