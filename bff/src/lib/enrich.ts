// Per-user state laid over a series DTO: favourite, rating, unread, what is new since you last looked, and
// the cover's dominant colour.
//
// This lived inside routes/catalog.ts, which meant the two rails served from routes/personal.ts -- your
// favourites and the contents of a collection -- returned raw DTOs with none of it. They had no `yomi` block
// and no `color`, so a favourite could not show a rating, could not show what was new, and could not be
// tinted. Nothing announced that; the fields were simply absent and every consumer read undefined.
//
// It also fixes a DTO that was lying. `seriesDto` in lib/ownedCatalog.ts has no user context, so it hardcodes
// booksReadCount 0 / booksUnreadCount = the total / booksInProgressCount 0. Every cover badge in the app reads
// booksUnreadCount, so every badge showed the chapter COUNT rather than how many were unread -- a number that
// never changed no matter how much you read. Those three fields are Komga-shaped and published in
// openapi.yaml, so the fix belongs here, in the one place that knows who is asking, rather than in each of
// the three components that render them.
