// Language editions of one work (v0.52.0, #72): Blue Lock in English and Blue Lock in Spanish as two series, each
// with its own folder, sources, chapters and reading progress, linked by lib_series.work_id so the Library shows
// one card for both, the series page and the reader switch between them, and a Komga or OPDS client can tell them
// apart. Every row in a work states its language (lib_series.lang), and a work holds one row per language: the
// partial unique index on (work_id, lang) in migrate.ts, which a removed edition keeps its slot in, so Put back
// can never collide.
//
// Grouping lives at the edges and only there: the add path links an edition here, the Library collapses a work to
// one card (ownedCatalog.ts searchSeries), the series page and the reader read editionInfo, Komga and OPDS suffix
// titles with editionLabels, and merge, forget and unlink dissolve a work left with a single edition. Everything
// else -- the listing, numbering, follows, the sweep, Health's per-series checks -- is per series, as it always was.
//
// ⚠️ A work of one is harmless and v0.51.0 can leave one behind (it never clears work_id on a merge or forget):
// every reader here treats "no live sibling" as standalone.
