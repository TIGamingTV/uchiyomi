/**
 * Reviewable import (backup / MangaDex list / paste → per-title match review → add), the fix for "import
 * forces an entry with no way to correct it". Unlike `importJob` above, this has a human in the middle who
 * may take a long time, so state lives in `import_batches`/`import_candidates` (migrate.ts) rather than in
 * memory — a restart or a closed tab must not throw away a finished resolve pass or a reviewer's picks.
 *
 * `resolvingBatch` is still an in-memory guard, same idea as `importJob.running`: it caps the SEARCH FAN-OUT
 * to one batch at a time server-wide (matching or resuming another batch while this one is mid-resolve would
 * double the outbound request rate to every source). It does not gate `/run` — adding series after review is
 * cheap to run concurrently with a second batch's resolve pass, and gating it too would only serve to make
 * reviewing batch A slower while batch B imports.
 *
 * `importingBatches` is the same kind of witness for `/run`: the batches whose add loops THIS process is
 * running -- a set, not one id, precisely because `/run` is not serialised across batches and a second
 * batch's run must not make the first look abandoned. A batch that reads `importing` in the database while
 * nobody here is importing it was stranded by a restart mid-run; GET flips it back to `review` (its rows
 * without a status are still ready, and `/run` only ever picks up rows it has not processed, so running
 * again is safe). Without that, such a batch polled "Importing…" forever: `/run` answered busy, `/resume`
 * answered not-resolving, the sweep skipped it.
 *
 * `aborted` is how DELETE reaches a loop already in flight. Both loops check it before picking up their next
 * row, so discarding a batch mid-resolve stops the searching (the fan-out the guard above exists to cap --
 * before this, clearing `resolvingBatch` let a NEW batch start while the old loop kept searching) and
 * discarding mid-run stops adding series for a batch that no longer exists. The row in flight finishes;
 * its writes then target rows the CASCADE removed and affect nothing.

   *   goes to live_* and the per-stage evidence Health reads (lib/sourceCheck.ts). No `reportFail`: three
   *   impatient clicks would take `consecutive` from 3 to 6 and the cooldown from 90 minutes to its ceiling. No
   *   status, and no checked_at either: the desktop app schedules the daily check from max(checked_at)
   *   (server.ts), so a Test that stamped it would postpone the check. Before v0.49.0 it wrote nothing at all,
   *   which is how a source could fail its Test while Health said "All good".
   * - **Passing does not clear the block.** It reports `canClear` and leaves the decision to the admin. The
   *   smoke test stops at listing page URLs and never fetches an image byte, while the downloader's own
   *   failures are about bytes: hotlink protection, HTML served where a JPEG was promised. Green here is not
