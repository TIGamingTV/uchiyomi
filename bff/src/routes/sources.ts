 * here is the one failure that would otherwise leave the card reading done with an empty report -- and

   * folder with nothing in it -- there is not even a folder yet -- would never become a row, and the add
   * would have created nothing to follow. The columns are the ones persistScan writes plus the routing
   * stamps the normal path adds afterwards; `library_id` is the same `libraryIdFor` answer persistScan would
   * pick for a brand-new folder, so when the first chapter arrives its `ON CONFLICT (library_id, folder)`
   * lands on THIS row and updates it in place rather than minting a second id -- and so the row sits in
   * the library its folder says it is in, as every scanned row does.
   *
   * The floor is a hair ABOVE the newest listed number, not at it: `chapter_floor` is inclusive from below
   * (`number < floor` is below, seriesListing.ts; `number >= floor` is wanted, updater.ts), so a floor of
   * `max + 0.001` puts every number the source lists today below the sweep's scope and the next release --
   * `max + 0.5`, `max + 1` -- inside it. A chapter numbered between `max` and `max + 0.001` would read as
   * older; no real numbering does that, and the openapi description says so. NULL when the source lists
   * nothing: there is nothing to be above, and every future chapter is wanted. An empty listing is not
   * `no_chapters` here -- an announced title with no chapters yet is the one this add exists for.
   *
   * No job, no download, no persistScan: the listing and the cover are written as the normal path writes
   * them, and the AniList art call runs as it does for every add. Re-adding hits the `existing` check above.
   * The next sweep (or a person fetching from the series page) creates the folder through the downloader's
   * mkdir, and persistScan then finds the row by folder.
   *
   * ⚠️ A row this folder already has is REVIVED, not shadowed. `existing` reaches this point only when the
   * row was deleted and the check above has just un-deleted it -- and the unique index is (library_id,
   * folder), so a plain INSERT answered 23505 for a series removed from the library and added back as
   * "nothing yet", AFTER the un-delete had already put it back: the dialog read "Add failed. Try another
   * source." for a series that was in the library again, and the next tap read "already in library". The
   * conflict lands on that row and refreshes its routing in place, so its id -- and every favourite, note
   * and read mark hung on it -- survives, as persistScan's own upsert keeps them across a rescan. The
   * library has to be the row's OWN for the conflict to find it: an admin can move a series to a library
   * its path would not pick (a deliberate UPDATE, library.ts), and `libraryIdFor` would then mint a second
   * row of the same folder one library over, which is exactly the stranding the index exists to stop.
   * Only a brand-new folder is assigned by path, as persistScan assigns one.
   *
   * Stamped as CHECKED, as stampChecked in updater.ts stamps a row after every sweep: this add has just
   * asked the source. Left NULL, the series page read `not checked yet` above a run row that listed the
   * very chapters this check had found, and the sources sheet showed no count and no "checked {ago}",
   * until the first sweep reached the row. `source_chapters` is the chooser's count -- one per number,
   * what the sweep stamps -- and `source_missing` is 0: every listed number is below the floor, so the

   * row alive, so Remove + "add it again with all chapters" -- which is the app's own advice when a series
   * looks wrong -- re-fetched the whole back catalogue and then filed every chapter a SECOND time:
   * persistScan merges both roots onto one series row by folder, so `Official_Chapter 1.cbz` under the read
   * library and `Chapter 1.cbz` under the download root are two rows with the same number. On the owner's
   * install that is 33,854 chapters under the read-only root, 30 series of which exist ONLY there.
   *
   * Three deliberate decisions:
   *  - By FOLDER, not by `existing?.id`: the folder is what persistScan keys on, and the row may predate
   *    this add entirely. A series the scanner found in the read library was never added through Discover,
   *    so `existing` is null for it -- and that is exactly the case that re-downloads the most.
   *  - `pruned_at IS NULL`, deliberately NOT `heldBooks()` (lib/chapterCleanup.ts). The sweep counts a
   *    Delete-files tombstone as HELD so it does not undo a deliberate deletion every night; an add is a
   *    person asking for those chapters NOW, so a tombstone must be fetched again. This is the one place
   *    in the product where the two rules differ, and it differs on purpose.
   *  - BOTH roots, because persistScan merges them onto the one row (lib/library.ts): the read-only
   *    library is where the missing chapters live, and the path check in lib/downloader.ts can only ever
   *    see DL_ROOT, under one filename convention.
   * The RAW number, as the sweep's own have-set reads it (lib/updater.ts): these numbers came out of a
   * source listing and are compared against one.
   * ⚠️ A failure here reads as "we hold nothing" and the add fetches everything, which is what it did
   * before this existed. Fetching twice is the old bug; skipping a chapter nobody holds would be a new one.

 * wrong pick. Capped at `RESOLVE_ALT_TITLES`: every alternate is one more outbound search on every source
 * that misses, and the batch already runs several rows in parallel.

 * alternate's weak `contains` hit on the first source pre-empted an exact hit for the title on the second
 * -- AniList synonyms are user-contributed ("AoT", "Atak Tytanów"), and "AoT" on a site that lacks the

   * What is missing from a series, and who could supply it -- answered as it goes (v0.48.4).
   *
   * Read-only. Answers with a plan id; the chapter URLs stay on this side of the wire and the fill below
   * quotes the id back. The client therefore names a chapter NUMBER and nothing else, so no request can
   * point the downloader at content a person was never shown.
   *
   * The scan asks every reachable source for the title and lists the chapters of each one that has it, and a
   * source behind Cloudflare may take SOLVER_BUDGET_MS (90 s) for either. It used to be one request that waited
   * for the slowest of them all: on an install whose series mostly come from such a source it ran 84 to 180 s,
   * the reverse proxy in front cut it off (nginx's proxy_read_timeout is 60 s by default), and the dialog said
   * "The scan failed." -- while the ☁ on a ghost chapter, which asks only the series' own sources, worked. So
   * the scan runs on its own now. POST starts it, or joins the one this person is already running for the same
   * series and title, and answers with whatever has arrived after SCAN_FIRST_ANSWER_MS (all of it, when every
   * source answers quickly). GET /api/sources/fill/scan/:id answers with the rest as it lands. No request waits
   * on a slow source, so no proxy's limit applies, and each source's card appears when THAT source answers:
   * the series' own source is listed from the start instead of after every other source has searched.
   *
   * POST rather than GET because it fans out across every reachable source, and a GET would be prefetchable
   * and service-worker-cacheable -- the same reasoning as `latestPage` above. The progress route is a GET: it
   * starts nothing, and it answers only the person who started the scan.

  /**
   * Fetch chapters the sources list but this server lacks -- the ghost rows on the series page.
   *
   * The last listing (lib/seriesListing.ts) IS the authorisation: a client names chapter NUMBERS, and only
   * a number the sources listed at the last check has a row to fetch from. The same footing as the fill
   * plan, for the same reason: no chapter URL crosses the wire, and a number nobody listed cannot be asked
   * for from anywhere. What is fetched is the copy the release rules chose at that check.
   *
   * Patience is ignored by construction: the chosen copy of a held number is the best copy on offer, and
   * a person clicking Fetch on a "waiting for group B" row is saying they will take it. The BLOCKLIST is
   * never ignored for a NUMBER: a number only blocked groups released has no chosen copy at all
   * (`blocked_group`), and the way to fetch it is to unblock the group and check again. A manual fetch also
   * resets the retry cap -- the ledger row goes, and a failure re-creates it at one attempt -- because "try
   * it again on purpose" is exactly what the cap was designed to leave room for.
   *
   * A PICK names one specific copy -- `{ number, source, sourceId }` out of the versions list -- and is
   * authorised by finding exactly that copy among the number's stored `copies` (`not_listed` otherwise):
   * still no chapter URL crosses the wire, and still only what a source has been seen to list can be asked
   * for. A pick ignores the group rules INCLUDING the blocklist. The blocklist governs what the sweep takes
   * on its own; the versions list labels a copy "blocked" and a person who taps Fetch on it anyway has made
   * an explicit choice of that one copy, which is a different act from asking for "the number". What a pick
   * never overrides is `already_here`: a live row for the number means the action is "fetch again", the
   * admin's, and a member must not be able to replace a file by naming another copy of it.
