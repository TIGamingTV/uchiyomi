  // endpoint (its legacy REST API has GETs with side effects), and the 502 for a non-2xx against the 500 for
  // a body sharp cannot decode was a two-state oracle for which engine paths exist. `engineCoverUrl` closes
  // the first and shrinks the second to "is there a manga with this id", which the source search already
  // answers: the only shape it accepts is the thumbnail the adapter produces, and the URL on the wire is
  // rebuilt from the operator base plus the numeric id -- the caller's string is never what gets fetched.

   *
   * The MISS is cached as deliberately as the hit. Without that, every source with no icon costs a fetch --
   * for a template site, two, including a homepage parse -- on every single page load, forever. A one-byte
   * sentinel is stored and served as a 404, so the second visit is a cache read.
   *
   * One day, not `immutable`: sites change their logo, and unlike a cover the URL carries no version. This
