# Changelog

## v0.55.8 — 2026-10-08

**Your Library sort is now a default, up to three Lists can live on Home, and each library can opt out of automatic
AniList lookups. Chapter cleanup is durable and recoverable, scanlator blocks apply safely everywhere, and Reduce
effects no longer leaves a page hidden after navigation.**

This release incorporates and credits **@TIGamingTV**'s chapter-management and scanlator work in
[#171](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/171), with the transaction, concurrency, recovery and authorization
guards needed for release.

### Library and Home

- **A Library sort becomes your default** when you click **Updated**, **Newest**, **A–Z** or **Most unread**, and follows
  your account to every device. A sort in a shared URL wins for that visit without changing the default. This completes
  the Library part of [#150](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/150).
- **Choose zero to three Lists for Home**, put them in positions 1–3, and move them earlier or later. Home follows that
  order and shows up to twelve series per rail. An empty selected List keeps its slot; choosing none means no List rails.
  Until the first edit, the old first-three-nonempty behaviour remains. This completes
  [#164](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/164).
- **Show all chapters at once** is an account setting: one page, every grey row, and older runs unfolded.

### Chapter cleanup and recovery

- **Delete downloaded chapters over a Library selection** is now a persisted background run:
  - the server answers before it starts unlinking, and the progress window can be closed or rejoined after a reload or
    proxy timeout;
  - only one run is active, cancellation happens between series, and an unexpected restart records *interrupted*
    instead of silently replaying deletion;
  - each series is rechecked at execution time, and the shared folder lock stays held through deletion, optional
    unmonitoring and its audit;
  - manual files, bookmarks, covers, chapter rows and reading progress remain. The confirmation warns that deleting a
    chapter somebody is reading can lose their position in that file.
- **Deleted chapters keep their identity.** Duplicate numbers and chapter ranges remain separate tombstones carrying
  their book id, range, deletion reason and every reader's progress.
- **Members who may download can restore a deliberate tombstone** from its grey row. Uchiyomi uses only that row's
  canonical stored source copy; it accepts no client-supplied path or source, and never falls back to another copy.
- **Why a file is absent is no longer blurred together:** `deleted` is deliberate, `missing` is Verify's evidence,
  and `rescan_missing` is a read-library file Rescan found absent. Ambiguous legacy rows are backfilled conservatively.
- **Show deleted chapters as ghosts** is consistent in the web app and the Komga-compatible list, detail and page
  routes. The reveal control counts both source ghosts and deliberate tombstones, so it cannot hide itself.
- **Unmonitor really means unattended work stops:** the sweep, partial completion, short and gap repair, Fix everything
  and the slow archive re-read the switch before each new source/network operation. Manual Check, Fetch and Fill remain.

### AniList privacy per library

Asked for in [#168](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/168):

- Every library, including the default one, has **Look up art and metadata on AniList automatically**.
- Off means no automatic art, title/id match, reading-direction/type repair, startup match check or scheduled enrichment
  for series currently in that library, and no negative lookup cache entry is made.
- Existing art, links, type and direction stay. Moving a series adopts the destination library's policy.
- Explicit Admin Art, Relink, Check online matches, tracker import/sync and Discover actions remain available and say
  that the action may contact AniList.

### Scanlator and source safety

- Blocking or unblocking a scanlator now rebuilds every affected stored choice in the same transaction as the
  preference. Concurrent checks are serialized, effective preferences are re-read under the lock, and a failed rebuild
  rolls the preference back instead of leaving settings and listings disagreeing.
- A blocked row retains its natural *available*, *held* or *covered* state, so unblocking restores the right one.
- Ordinary Fetch, the slow archive, partial repair and same-release rotation all apply the same blocklist. Only a copy
  explicitly pinned by a person may override a block, and a pinned copy never falls back. A 403/429 refusal never
  triggers fallback or a source hunt.

### Reader, navigation and dependencies

- **Reduce effects navigation is visible again:** in-app links switch synchronously in that mode, so an outgoing page
  cannot leave the main body hidden. Fixes [#174](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/174), reported by
  **@AlexisJAnderson**.
- The reader's **Cover colour at the edges** setting from v0.55.7 remains available under both reader and profile
  settings, as requested in [#170](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/170).
- **Security dependency:** sharp 0.35.5, from Dependabot
  [#173](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/173).

### Upgrading

- **Database:** additive changes only:
  - `libraries.anilist_lookup`;
  - `series_listing.unblocked_status`;
  - the persisted `admin_bulk_delete_runs` table and its chapter-level `current` progress snapshot;
  - the `admin_bulk_delete_items` intent journal used to reconcile an interrupted unlink without repeating it;
  - the new `rescan_missing` value in the existing `lib_books.pruned_reason` provenance field, with an audited legacy
    backfill.

  v0.55.7 can run on the same database, so rolling back the application is still one image-pin change. A database
  restore cannot recover files deliberately deleted by a cleanup.
- **For scripts** ([api.md](docs/api.md)):
  - `/api/settings` validates `librarySort`, `homeCollections` and `showAllChapters`, while retaining unknown keys;
  - library create/update accepts `anilistLookup`, and library rows carry `anilist_lookup`;
  - Book responses carry stable tombstone identity, range, progress and `rescan_missing`; new
    `POST /api/books/:id/refetch` restores one canonical deliberate tombstone;
  - bulk chapter delete is `POST` → **202** `{runId}`, `GET` for persisted progress, and `POST .../cancel`;
  - admin settings document `deleted_as_ghosts`.

## v0.55.7 — 2026-10-07

**Online matches must carry the series' name, Rescan everything merges moved folders, and the reader's cover-colour edges
get a switch. Lists gain unread badges and sorting, and scans are faster on slow disks.**

### Online matches carry the series' name

- **The cause:**
  - For a series with no source, Uchiyomi looked its title up on AniList (and MangaDex for art) and took the top answer
    without checking its name.
  - Two of **@Kedryn**'s *Morgan Lost* comics got a manga's cover that way
    ([#168](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/168)).
  - The same wrong answer became the series' AniList link, so progress was pushed there, and it could group two unrelated
    series as duplicates.
- **Now:** an AniList, MangaDex or Kitsu answer counts only when one of its names is the series' name or one of its other
  names (a leading "The", "A" or "An" aside when the remaining name is long enough). A spin-off is not the work.
- **What's already stored gets checked:**
  - *Check online matches* (Admin → Tasks) goes over every automatic AniList link and every cover or banner found online,
    a few minutes after the upgrade.
  - It removes those that belong to another work. It never touches a link you made or your own art choices.
  - On the maintainer's library the final pre-release dry run kept 192 of 194 links and identified 2 for removal.
- **Health's *Duplicate series*** only groups links a person made or the check confirmed, so *Fix everything* never merges on a
  wrong match.
- **Edit details → Cover → Use the first page** keeps the series' own first page as its cover, whatever a lookup finds. Admin →
  Art has it too.

### Rescan everything: merged folders and renamed files

- **A chapter follows its renamed or moved file**, keeping everyone's reading history. It no longer shows twice.
- **Merge "Zagor 1-100" into "Zagor":** when every chapter of a series moved into one other series' folder, the preview offers
  the merge for you to tick. Reading history, favourites and lists follow. Reported by **@Kedryn**
  ([#150](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/150)).
- **Moves are recognised sooner:**
  - Files are fingerprinted a few minutes after a scan finds them, and never mid-unpack, so a later move is recognised.
  - A file moved before it was fingerprinted is recognised by its name and its exact modification time, when exactly one file
    matches.
- **The scheduled update check** leaves a series alone while Rescan, a renumber or a download holds it.

### Faster scans on slow disks

A scan reopened the first chapter file of every series to read its details. Now it does so only when that file has changed. On
2,000 series on a slow disk, a rescan with nothing new went from about 56 seconds to about 13.

### Reader

- **Cover colour at the edges:** the soft wash of the cover's colour at the top and bottom of the reader can be switched off.
  - It's in *Profile → Settings → Reading* or in the reader's own settings, and on by default.
  - Asked about by **@jordanske** ([#170](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/170)).
- **The controls** no longer leave a thin gap at the screen edge as they spring in. Spotted by **@DannyDynamite39**.

### Lists

Asked for by **@AlexisJAnderson** ([#164](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/164)):

- **Badges:** every series in a list shows the Library's unread badge, and its NEW, favourite and offline marks.
- **Sorting:** *Your order*, *A–Z*, *Z–A*, *Last read*, *Most unread* or *Latest chapter*, remembered per list.
- **Editing:** *Edit* replaces the hidden delete button. It removes a series, or moves it in your own order.
- **Adding:** a series added to a list goes to its end.

### Smaller

- **Placeholder group names:** sites that label every chapter "Unofficial" or "Unknown" no longer count as one scanlation group,
  so downloads only take turns between them when their page counts agree
  ([#158](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/158)).
- **Series page:** "File no longer on disk" and "Deleted from the server" are never cut off.
- **Translations:** every message in the app is now translated, including the last English-only notices and Admin → Art. In
  Arabic, "99+" reads correctly and counts read correctly for any number.
- **`LIBRARY_REMATCH`** never moves a series onto a folder that has its own.
- **Dependencies:** Next.js 16.3.8, Electron 44.5.1, pg 8.23.1, sharp 0.35.5, and others.

### Upgrading

- **Database:** additive columns only:
  - `series_trackers.checked_at`, `series_art.checked_at`;
  - `lib_series.info_read`;
  - `server_settings.match_check_last_run` / `match_check_last_result`.

  v0.55.6 runs on the same database, so going back is one line of your compose file.
- **After the upgrade:**
  - *Check online matches* runs in the background, paced for AniList, for a few minutes.
  - What it removes is listed in its result and in the audit log. A tracker import re-links a series by id.
- **For scripts** ([api.md](docs/api.md)):
  - `GET /api/collections/:id` items carry `lastReadAt` and `latestChapterAt`.
  - New settings keys: `reader.coverEdges` and `listSorts`.
  - Rescan's plan and apply gain `follow` and `merges`.
  - The cover mode `first_page`, and the `matches` task.
  - `ANILIST_API_URL` also moves the title and id lookups.

## v0.55.6 — 2026-10-06

**A library scan that takes minutes no longer reads "Scan failed": the scan answers at once, and the page follows it
to its end with how far it has got.**

### Long library scans no longer fail

- **The cause:** *Scan library now* waited for the whole scan before it answered. A big library on a slow disk can
  take minutes (Unraid shares, a NAS). That's longer than a proxy in front of the server will hold a request: nginx gives
  up at 60 seconds, Cloudflare at 100. So the button said *Scan failed* every time while the scan went on. Reported by
  **@Kedryn** ([#150](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/150)).
- **Now:** the server answers within 15 seconds, and the page follows the scan until it ends.
  - The admin home and Health show how far it has got: *Folder 1,200 of 3,400*, a ticking clock, then the counts.
  - A request a proxy cuts off follows the scan it started instead of failing.
- **A scan that really fails says why,** in the server's words, instead of a bare *Scan failed*.

### Upgrading

- **Database:** no change. v0.55.5 runs on the same database, so going back is one line of your compose file.
- **New setting:** `REFRESH_FIRST_ANSWER_MS` (default `15000`), how long *Scan library now* waits before it answers
  that the scan is still running.
- **For scripts** ([api.md](docs/api.md)):
  - `POST /api/refresh` answers `running: true` and `since` when the scan takes longer than that.
  - It answers `scanned: false, reason: 'error'` when the scan fails, with the server's `message` for an admin.
  - New `GET /api/refresh` says whether a scan runs, and for an admin its progress and how the last one ended.

## v0.55.5 — 2026-10-06

**Normal titles are no longer counted as 18+: a site that flags itself 18+ no longer marks every title it shares with
other sites, and Natomanga's series keep their own genres instead of the site's whole genre menu.**

### Fewer false 18+ in Discover search

- **The cause:** each extension says whether its site has adult content, and the extension index flags a whole site when
  it hosts any adult title. General sites such as **AllManga**, 11toon and Manga Bab carry the flag too.
- **What went wrong:** since v0.55.4, one flagged site among a title's sources made the whole card 18+. With **Show 18+**
  on, most manhwa AllManga also carries wore the **18+** mark under *All*, vanished under *Hide 18+* and showed under
  *18+ only*.
- **Now:** a site's own flag makes a title 18+ only when no other site carries it. A MangaDex erotica or pornographic
  rating, a genre on your 18+ list, or a source you named on it still make a title 18+ wherever it is found.
- **Unchanged:** with Show 18+ off, flagged sites aren't searched at all, and a flagged site's own row of results stays
  behind 18+.

### Natomanga series keep their own genres

- **The cause:** Natomanga's series pages now carry the site's whole genre menu, and Uchiyomi read every genre link on
  the page. Some series got all 69 genres, Adult, Hentai and Smut among them; on the owner's library that was 12 series,
  such as *Return of the War God* and *The Glutton*.
- **Now:** genres come from the series' own genre row only (Natomanga and Mangakakalot).
- **Repaired on upgrade:**
  - series that already hold the menu get their own genres back;
  - they get a series type where those genres name one, so the notice-chapter switches apply to them;
  - neither a chapter file still carrying the menu nor a new add from any source brings it back.
- It hid nothing on its own, since the library hides by genre only for genres on your 18+ list. But those series showed
  dozens of genre chips and turned up under Hentai.

### Upgrading

- **Database:** no new column. A one-time step cleans genres holding a site's genre menu, in series and in their Edit
  details overrides, and types those series from what is left. v0.55.4 runs on the same database, so going back is one
  line of your compose file.
- **For scripts** ([api.md](docs/api.md)): in `GET /api/sources/search-all`, a provider 18+ only by its extension's
  flag makes a card 18+ only when every provider is one. Providers still carry `rating: adult` for it.

## v0.55.4 — 2026-10-05

**Easier to find: the version at the foot of the admin menu, "Import your library" where a new library starts, and a
search that finds settings. Plus *Rescan everything*, downloads that use every source carrying a release, and an 18+
filter in Discover search.**

### Easier to find

- **The running version is at the foot of the admin menu**, with *up to date* or *update available*, which links to the
  release. On a phone it ends the admin header.
- **"Import your library"** appears on an empty Library and on Home's welcome. It takes a Mihon or Tachiyomi backup, a
  MangaDex list, your AniList, MyAnimeList or Kitsu list, or pasted titles. The Library header also has *Import a list*
  for admins. Until now it was only under Admin → Sources → Add sources.
- **The search box (Ctrl+K, or the phone's Search page) also finds pages and settings by name**, in your language and in
  English: *notice*, *import*, *version*, *solver*, *backup time*, *2FA* and the like. A result opens the page and
  scrolls to the setting.
- Asked for by **@Kedryn** ([#150](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/150)) and **@DannyDynamite39**
  ([#158](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/158)).

### Rescan everything

**Admin → Tasks → Rescan everything** re-reads every folder and shows a preview before it changes anything:
- **Gone:** chapters whose files are gone from your own folders.
- **Kept:** files that were only moved or renamed (matched by their contents).
- **Download folder:** chapters missing there, left to *Verify chapter files*.
- **Empty series:** series with nothing left, each with a link.

On **Apply**, the gone chapters read *File no longer on disk*. Nothing is erased and no file is touched: everyone's
reading history stays, and a file that comes back is picked up again by the next scan. It refuses a folder that looks
unmounted, leaves alone files it couldn't read, and checks everything again right before applying.

**Optionally, number chapters again by the v0.55.2 file-name rules,** for the series you tick: chapter words, `#12`,
years in brackets, ranges like `01-07`. The preview shows each series' changes first, with how many readers and trackers
they touch, and nothing is sent to a tracker. Asked for by **@Kedryn** ([#150](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/150)).

### Downloads that use every source carrying a release

- **The slow archive and *Fetch all*** take a series' chapters from every source you follow that carries the same
  release (the same scanlation group), in turn. Sources on different image servers download side by side.
- **Sites on one image server count as one**, like Natomanga and Mangakakalot, so turns never double the requests to it.
- **What never changes source:** a chapter you picked yourself, a series with its own source order, posting-order
  series, and the regular update check.
- **In a test with two image servers,** a 12-chapter *Fetch all* took 1.4 minutes instead of 2.8, and each server got
  half the requests.
- Asked for by **@DannyDynamite39** ([#158](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/158)).

### An 18+ filter in Discover search

- **Search results can be filtered:** *All · Hide 18+ · 18+ only*. A result is 18+ when the source says so, when MangaDex
  rates it erotica or pornographic, or when it carries one of your 18+ genres. Results with no rating stay under *All*
  and *Hide 18+*. Adult results carry a small *18+* mark.
- **With Show 18+ off, search now hides adult results** too. Before, MangaDex's erotica still showed.
- Asked for by **@DannyDynamite39** ([#158](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/158)).

### Smaller

- **A series whose cover chapter's file is gone** now shows no cover; it used to answer with an error.
- **A Rescan that changes a series waits for it:** a series with a download or a check running is left alone for the
  next Rescan, and a Fetch or the archive waits for the Rescan to finish.

### Upgrading

- **Database:** two nullable columns on server settings, `rescan_last_run` and `rescan_last_result`. v0.55.3 runs on the
  same database, so going back is one line of your compose file.
- **For scripts** ([api.md](docs/api.md)):
  - `GET /api/admin/stats` carries `version`.
  - `POST /api/admin/tasks/rescan/run`, `GET …/rescan/status` and `POST …/rescan/apply` drive the rescan.
  - `GET /api/sources/search-all` takes `rating=all|safe|adult` and marks results with `rating`.
  - MangaDex results carry `contentRating`.
  - A chapter carries `prunedReason`.

## v0.55.3 — 2026-10-05

**A backup Cloudflare solver, gentler downloads from sites that ask for fewer requests, and failed chapters that follow
their series to a new source.**

### A backup Cloudflare solver

- **`FLARESOLVERR_FALLBACK_URL`** sets a second solver. When the main one doesn't answer a request with a page (it's
  down, it timed out, it answered with an error or an empty page, or it stays busy), the same request goes to the
  backup.
- **Each site goes first to the solver that last solved it,** for 6 hours. Its Cloudflare pass (the cookie and browser
  identity) is kept per solver, so downloads use the pass of the solver that earned it.
- **A solver that is only busy is waited for, not blamed.** When a solver answers *too many requests* itself (trawl does
  when all its browsers are in use), Uchiyomi waits, retries, then asks the backup. It never counts as the site refusing.
- **trawl is recognised as itself.** Health says *Ready (trawl v1.7.0)* and checks trawl's own releases; before, it was
  compared with FlareSolverr's and read as a false "update available". [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)
  describes FlareSolverr, trawl and Byparr, with a compose example of trawl as the main solver and FlareSolverr as the
  backup. On a real library, once trawl had solved a site, its next pages took about 2 s instead of about 12 s.
- **Health's solver card lists both solvers.** It is amber when one is down and the other keeps solving, and needs
  attention only when both are down. Fix everything says a down solver clears by itself while the other one works.
- trawl's own error messages are read for what they mean.

### Gentler with a site that asks for fewer requests

- **Downloads stay slow longer.** After a site's image server answers *too many requests* (HTTP 429), downloads from it
  stay slower for at least an hour. They speed up one step at a time, after a run of good chapters. Before, they sped up
  after the first success and were refused again.
- **One chapter at a time while slowed,** and a refusal pauses every chapter from that site, not just the one refused.
- **Sources whose pages come from the same image server share one pace,** like Natomanga and Mangakakalot.
- Health says *Downloading slowly: the site asked for fewer requests* on such a source.
- **Measured on a test server allowing 60 requests a minute:** 6 of 18 chapters failed before; now 2 of 18 do, and only on
  the first night. Downloads take about twice as long.

### Failed chapters follow their series

- **When a series moves to another main source,** the chapters that had failed on the old source move with it and are
  tried again from the new one. A move is a Replace, Make main, Fix everything, or a source being unfollowed or removed.
  Before, they stayed filed under the old source, where Health counted them as failing and Fix everything listed them as
  needing you.
- Chapters already left behind are moved on first start.
- While the new source is rate-limited or slowed, they show as waiting.

### Fix everything tries the extensions most people read first

- The download counts that order the extension search no longer favour recently updated extensions. The big sites now
  come first: MangaDex, MangaFire, Asura Scans, Comick, Weeb Central, Mangakakalot and the like. Everything is still tried
  eventually.

### Notice chapters: "Only hide short ones"

- A new switch under **Admin → Settings → Notice chapters**, **on by default**, keeps today's rule: only chapters numbered
  like 12.5 with 3 pages or fewer are hidden.
- Turned off, it hides every chapter numbered like 12.5 of the types switched on, including real chapters a site split
  into parts.
- Asked for by **@TIGamingTV** ([#147](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/147)).

### Upgrading

- **Database:** one new column (`server_settings.hide_notice_short_only`, on by default), and a one-time move of failed
  chapters left under a source their series no longer uses. Both happen by themselves. v0.55.2 runs on the same
  database, so going back is one line of your compose file.
- **New optional setting:** `FLARESOLVERR_FALLBACK_URL` (CONFIGURATION.md → *The Cloudflare solver*). Nothing changes
  until you set it.
- **For scripts** ([api.md](docs/api.md)):
  - `GET` and `PATCH /api/admin/settings` carry `hideNoticeShortOnly`.
  - Source states gain `slowed`.
  - Health's solver card gains its main and backup rows.
  - A failed chapter can be `moved`.

## v0.55.2 — 2026-10-04

**Hand-collected comics get the right chapter numbers from their file names, and the notice "chapters" some sites post
can be hidden.** Both apply only from now on or only when you switch them on: nothing already in your library is
renumbered, and nobody's read status changes on upgrading.

### Chapter numbers from file names

For files added from now on:
- **A chapter word wins:** `Vol 3 Chapter 12.cbz` is chapter 12, not 3 (*Ch*, *Chapter*, *Cap*, *Capitolo*,
  *Capítulo*, *Chapitre*, *Kapitel* and their short forms).
- **Otherwise `#` makes the number the chapter:** `Batman #12 (1987).cbz` is 12.
- **A year is never the chapter:** a 4-digit year in `( )` or `[ ]` is skipped. A name with only a year, like
  `Watchmen (1986).cbz`, gets no chapter number and sorts by name.
- **A range is one file holding several chapters:** `Batman 01-07.cbz` shows as *Ch. 1–7*. Chapters 2 to 6 don't count
  as missing, and finishing it tells your tracker 7.

Files the downloader saves (`Chapter 12.cbz`) read exactly as before, and *Edit number & title* still overrides any
chapter. Suggested by **@Kedryn** ([#150](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/150)).

### Notice chapters, if you switch them on

- Some sites post an announcement (a hiatus, a delay) as a short chapter numbered after the latest one, like *100.5*.
  **Admin → Settings → Notice chapters** has a switch for each series type: Manga, Manhwa, Manhua, Webtoon, Comic and
  other. For each type switched on, chapters numbered like 12.5 with **3 pages or fewer** are hidden from the library,
  the reader, Updates, OPDS and Mihon, and one a site lists as that short isn't downloaded.
- Longer ones stay, because those are real chapters a site split into parts, and so does any chapter whose pages
  haven't been counted yet. Nothing is deleted: switching a type off shows them all again.
- A series can override its type in its *Sources & translations* sheet, which also shows how many are hidden.
- *Edit details* has a **Series type**, filled in automatically from the series' genres, then its source, then AniList.
- All the switches are off by default, and while they're off it costs nothing.
- Contributed by **@TIGamingTV** ([#147](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/147)). The page rule was added at
  merge: on a real library, about 170 of 1,759 chapters numbered like 12.5 were notices of 3 pages or fewer, while about
  1,500 were real chapters of 6 pages or more.

### Upgrading

- **Database changes, all additive and made by themselves:**
  - new columns on series (`series_type`, `series_type_from`, `hide_notices`) and series overrides (`series_type`);
  - one on server settings (`hide_notice_types`);
  - three on chapter files: `name_rule` (which rule read the name, so existing chapters keep theirs), `number_end` (a
    range's last chapter) and `created_at`;
  - one index.

  On first start, every series without a type gets one from its genres. v0.55.1 runs on the same database, so going
  back is one line of your compose file; while it runs it reads every file name the old way.
- **For scripts** ([api.md](docs/api.md)):
  - `GET` and `PATCH /api/admin/settings` carry `hideNoticeTypes`.
  - Series carry `seriesType`, `hideNotices`, `hideNoticesEffective` and `hiddenNotices`.
  - A chapter that holds a range carries `numberEnd`, and its number reads like *1–7*.

## v0.55.1 — 2026-10-04

**Fix everything no longer mistakes a busy site for a broken one, and it keeps looking for an extension that carries
your series until it finds one, the most popular first. Libraries can also hold several folders, and the Library can
show the series with no source.** The first real Fix everything run moved series off a
site that was only asking for a pause, and moved three of them onto a site that could not load pages. Both causes are
fixed, and the next run undoes it.

### Fix everything, after its first real run

- **A site asking for a pause is not broken.** When a site answers *too many requests* (HTTP 429), its source now cools
  down instead of failing: Health shows it as *Rate limited*, with no Replace, Fix everything never moves series off it,
  and its chapters are listed as waiting for the site's pause (*Clears by itself* at the end of a run, and greyed on
  Health's *Chapters that would not download*), not as failing.
- **Replace never moves a series onto a source that cannot download it.** A source whose search works but whose pages
  fail is never a destination, and one run never moves a series onto a source it is replacing. A series already moved
  onto such a source is moved again, to one that carries it.
- **Retries leave a site that asked for a pause alone,** so a run no longer makes its limit worse.
- **Extensions: no cap, the most popular first.** Fix everything keeps trying extensions, one at a time, until the
  series is found or the run's time is up, and the next run continues where it stopped. It tries first an extension
  named after one of the series' own translation groups, then the most downloaded ones, from the extension
  repository's own download counts on GitHub (read once a day), then the rest. An extension that finds nothing is
  removed straight away, and it is not tried again for the same series for a month. 18+ extensions are tried only for
  18+ series. The end says it in one line: *Tried 6 extensions and kept Gap Scans*.

### Libraries with several folders

- **A library can hold several folders** (Admin → Libraries): tick them in the folder browser, where a folder another
  library holds says so. Saving moves their series in or out at once, and the dialog says how many before. The most
  specific folder still wins. Suggested by **@Kedryn** ([#148](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/148)).

### "No source" in the Library's filters

- **Main source → No source** lists the series with no source to download from: folders you added by hand, and
  anything never matched to a site. Suggested by **@Kedryn** ([#149](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/149)).

### Smaller

- Health names every source on *Series that can no longer update* by its name, never an id like `sw:2522…`.
- A source the engine's source limit left out says so on its sheet (*The engine's limit of 40 sources is full*) and no
  longer offers Replace. Health tells it apart from an extension that is no longer installed.
- For an admin who hides 18+, Fix everything's lines now leave out only the 18+ series' names, not every series' name.
- Deleting a library unpins the series it held by hand, and the move preview reads right in every language.
- The repository no longer tracks a `web/node_modules` link that v0.55.0 committed by accident, which stopped
  contributors from pulling.

### Upgrading

- **One new table,** `library_paths` (a library's folders), created and filled by itself. v0.55.0 runs on the same
  database and files new folders by each library's first folder, so going back is one line of your compose file; the
  next v0.55.1 start repairs whatever v0.55.0 changed in between.
- **Settings** ([CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)): `AUTOFIX_INSTALLS` now defaults to no cap (`0` still
  switches the extensions part off). New: `GITHUB_API_URL`, where the download counts are read.
- **What leaves your server:** once a day, Fix everything reads the extension repository's download counts from
  GitHub, the same place extensions are installed from. Nothing is sent.
- **For scripts** ([api.md](docs/api.md)):
  - `POST /api/series/search` takes `hasMainSource` (`isTrue`, `isFalse`), and `GET /api/library/sources` adds `none`.
  - The libraries routes take and return `paths`, saves answer `moved`, a 409 names the library that holds a folder,
    and a PATCH of an unknown library answers 404.
  - `GET /api/admin/sources/overview` marks a source the limit left out with `overLimit`.
  - Fix everything's lines that name a series carry `seriesIds`, and its history leaves out `tried`.
  - Source health records a refusal for room as its own kind, `rate_limited`.

## v0.55.0 — 2026-10-03

**Health's Fix all is now Fix everything, and it can do the whole job by itself: Fix it for me works through every
card until it is green, then says in a few lines what it did and what only you can fix.** Until now Fix all was only
the repair's four steps. It skipped broken sources, series stuck on a dead source, duplicates, numbering, odd chapter
numbers and chapters saved twice, and it disappeared when only those were left.

### Fix everything

- **Health** has a **Fix everything** key beside Re-check whenever any card has a finding. It asks one thing:
  - **Fix it for me** (the default): replaces broken sources, fetches missing and broken chapters, and finds new
    sources, installing up to 3 extensions if it has to. It also merges duplicate series, deletes chapters saved twice
    or numbered impossibly, and applies safe renumbering. Those can't be undone, and the sheet says so before Start.
  - **Let me choose:** the safe repair as before (retries, short chapters, gaps), and the rest card by card.
- **The run** goes through ten steps, with the step, a progress bar and what it is doing now. **Run in background**
  keeps it going; it shows on **Server tasks** as *Fixing everything*, and reopening Health's sheet shows the run.
  **Stop** ends it at the next safe point, never inside a merge, a delete or a renumber.
- **The end** is short: one headline (**All green**, or *2 need you* with *Everything else is green* under it), up to
  six lines of what it did (*Moved 184 series off Aqua Manga*, *Fetched 37 missing chapters*, *Installed Asura Scans
  (found 3 series)*), what only you can fix, each with its one key, and what clears by itself, with a time. The rest
  is under **Details**. **Run again** shows only when a run could still change something.
- **Every night** (Admin → Settings) can be the **Safe repair**, as before and still the default, or **Fix
  everything**. Recent repairs lists Fix everything runs with their headline.

### What it does, and what it never does

- **Sources:** it tests the failing ones and clears a block only after a passing test, then **Replaces** each broken
  source that some series use as their main source, and turns off the broken ones nothing uses. A cause in your
  set-up (the engine, the source limit, a hidden language) is never "fixed" by replacing.
- **Duplicates:** two copies of a series in different languages are linked as editions. Two copies in the same
  language are merged only when the AniList id, the language and the titles (or most of the chapters) agree. It keeps
  the copy on a working source, and that copy now follows the other one's main source too.
- **Numbering:** only plans marked clean are applied. The rest wait for you.
- **Extensions:** for series no source carries any more, and gaps nobody had, it tries extensions in the series'
  language, the ones whose name matches the series' own translation groups first. It switches on only that language,
  keeps a package that found something and removes one that didn't. At most 3 a run.
- **Files:** it deletes the later copy of a chapter saved twice only when the copy kept is complete and at least as
  long, and an impossible chapter number with the delete key's own checks. Nothing bookmarked and nothing outside the
  download folder is ever deleted; those go to *Needs you*.
- **Never Ignore.** What a run can't fix (the solver or the engine down, folders mounted twice, a chapter no site
  has) is listed under *Needs you*, never hidden.
- It refuses to start beside a repair, a Find or Replace, or the sweep, and says which. A Find pressed while it runs
  says that Fix everything is already finding sources.

### Fixed on the way

- **The nightly gap step** searched the same five biggest gaps every night, so the rest were never looked at. It now
  takes the least recently checked first, and skips the ones just found missing everywhere.
- **Chapters before where a series starts** (*Latest N*) were filed as "the sweep will fetch it" and never were. They
  are now an info line, *before where you started*, not a finding.
- **Series stuck because of the source limit** offered Replace, which could not help. They now offer **Free a slot**,
  which opens the source in Admin → Sources.
- **A newly installed extension could push sources your series use past the engine's source limit**
  (`SUWAYOMI_MAX_SOURCES`) and freeze them. The sources your series use now always register first.
- **Merging two copies of a series** dropped the absorbed copy's main source. It is now kept as a source the
  remaining copy follows.
- **A chapter numbered impossibly** (a 2024 in a series of 80) showed as a gap of thousands of chapters on Health and
  sent the gap step searching for them. It is the odd chapter numbers card's alone now.

### Upgrading

- **One new database column,** `server_settings.nightly_mode` (default `repair`), added by itself. v0.54.1 runs on the
  same database, so going back is one line of your compose file. Nothing changes in compose files.
- **Optional settings** ([CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)): `AUTOFIX_MAX_MINUTES` (90), `AUTOFIX_SEARCHES`
  (60) and `AUTOFIX_INSTALLS` (3; `0` stops it installing extensions).
- **For scripts** ([api.md](docs/api.md)):
  - `POST /api/admin/health/autofix` starts a run (409 `busy` with what is running), `GET` answers the live run and
    the last one, `GET …/:runId` one run, and `POST …/stop` stops it. The summary's lines are said codes.
  - `GET` and `PATCH /api/admin/settings` carry `nightlyMode` (`repair` or `autofix`).
  - `GET /api/admin/tasks/repair/runs` lists Fix everything runs as `kind: "autofix"`, and `GET /api/sources/jobs`
    carries its run card. `POST /api/admin/sources/find` answers 409 `autofix_running` beside one.
  - Health's stuck-series rows carry `free_slot` for the source limit, and a merge's answer carries `carried`.

## v0.54.1 — 2026-10-03

### Byparr works as the Cloudflare solver

- **@DannyDynamite39** runs Byparr, a FlareSolverr-compatible solver, and pointed `FLARESOLVERR_URL` at it
  ([#144](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/144)). Solving already worked, since Byparr answers
  FlareSolverr's own requests, but Uchiyomi checked that the solver was up by FlareSolverr's greeting at its address.
  Byparr sends that address to its docs, so Health said the solver was not answering while it solved fine, and the
  repair skipped its solver step. Uchiyomi now also accepts the solver's `/health` answer, and compares the version
  with FlareSolverr's latest release only when it is FlareSolverr.
- The extension engine has a Cloudflare helper of its own. **Connect** points it at the same address, but whether the
  engine itself works with Byparr is up to the engine.

## v0.54.0 — 2026-10-03

**Admin → Providers and Admin → Extensions are now one place, Admin → Sources, and a source that stopped working can
be replaced in one press: its series move to sources that work, and it is turned off.** Until now nothing could change
a series' main source. Find other sources added followers, so a series whose site went offline kept that site as its
main source for good, in every count, filter and queue.

### One Sources section

- **Admin → Sources** holds every source, of every kind: the built-in ones, MangaDex's languages, the sites you
  added by address and every extension's sources. One list, the ones your series use first, each row one line
  (*Healthy · 125 series · English*) and at most one key. The switched-off ones fold away.
- **Needs attention** comes first, when there is anything: a broken source your series depend on, with **Replace**;
  the failing sources nothing uses, with **Turn off all**; extension updates, with **Update**.
- **Test all** tests every source, with how far it has got. **Add sources** has the extensions catalogue, adding a
  site by its address, MangaDex's languages and Import a list.
- **One sheet for every source:** how it is doing (with the evidence under *Details*), how many series use it, which
  opens the Library on them, **Test**, **Replace**, **Turn off** or **on** (which asks first when series use it) and
  **Remove** for a site, and, for an extension, its languages and settings.
- **Old links still land.** `?tab=Providers`, `?tab=Extensions`, `card=mangadex` and `settings=` open the same things
  in Sources, so bookmarks and notifications keep working.

### Replace a source

- **Replace** on a broken source says what it will do before it does it: *184 already follow a working source: it
  becomes their main source. The other 11 are searched for on your other sources. It is turned off once nothing uses
  it.* Then it does it, with the series moving as you watch and the count of moved, newly found and not replaced.
- A series that already follows a working source moves at once: the best of them becomes its main source, by health,
  then by how many of your chapters it carries, then your source order. One that follows none is searched for, under
  its other names too, and the first match becomes its main source. A series numbered by posting order is left alone
  and says why: its numbers come from its main source.
- **Let me review each match first** shows every move before it happens, with **Make main** and **Make all green
  main**.
- **Make main** is also on each working source in a series' *Sources & translations*, for one series at a time.
- Nothing moves on disk: chapters stay in the series' folder, and what you read stays read. A chapter that had failed
  too often on the old source gets another try from the new one.

### Turned off means off

- A switched-off source was still asked for every chapter list by the scheduled check, and new chapters could still
  be downloaded from it, whatever the button said. Now a switched-off source is never asked and never downloaded
  from, and a series whose every source is off is skipped until one is back.
- **Health** leads with **Replace** on a broken source that some series use as their main source. *Series that can no
  longer update* now also lists series whose main source is broken or switched off with nothing working to fall back
  on, and a switched-off source no longer counts as a working backup.
- A source still main to any series cannot be removed or retired: *It is the main source of 3 series. Replace it
  first.* A site added by address could be removed before, and its series stopped updating without a word.

### Upgrading

- **No database change.** v0.53.1 runs on the same database, and nothing changes in compose files or the environment.
- **A behaviour change:** turning a source off now stops its chapter lists too, not just its downloads. Turn it back on
  to see its lists again.
- **For scripts** ([api.md](docs/api.md)):
  - `GET /api/admin/sources/overview`: every source with its kind, standing, series counts and what needs attention.
  - `POST /api/admin/series/:id/main-source` `{sourceId, old?}` makes a followed source the main one. It answers 409
    for posting order, a pending renumber, a series being checked, a source switched off, unloaded or in another
    language, and a source not followed.
  - `POST /api/admin/sources/find` takes `mode: "replace"` (with `turnOff`), with
    `GET /api/admin/sources/:id/replace-preview` and `POST /api/admin/sources/find/:runId/promote`. Runs carry
    `mode`, `promoted`, `left`, `turnedOff`, `sourceId` and `sourceName`.
  - `POST /api/admin/sources/:id/retire` `{how}` turns off or removes a source no series has as its main source,
    and `DELETE /api/admin/sources/custom/:id` refuses while the site is in use.
  - Series sources carry `standing`, and Health's source rows and frozen series carry `replace_source`.

## v0.53.1 — 2026-10-03

**Find other sources asks the sources you can see, and learns a series' other names before it searches.** Both, and a
repair for installs whose other names could not be read, are **@TIGamingTV**'s
([#141](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/141)).

### Find other sources finds manhwa again

- **Sources marked 18+.** A run asked a source that flags itself adult only for a series rated 18+, the background
  hunt's rule. Most manhwa extensions flag themselves adult, so on a library that reads them nearly every series ended
  with *no other source could be asked* or *no match*. A run, and a review's **Follow**, now ask every source the admin
  who started it may see, as Discover and following a source by hand already do. The background hunt keeps its rule.
- **Other names before the search.** A series added before v0.49.1 has no other names stored, so it was searched
  under its own title alone, and a manhwa whose sites each romanise it another way matched nothing. A run now first
  takes the names its description lists, and only when that gives none, its main source's description: once, with a
  time limit, and never while that source is switched off, cooling down or already failed in the run. They are kept
  like any other name, so a name you removed stays removed.
- When a series has no source to ask, the server log now says why, by count.

### Upgrading

- **The database:** an install that ran the fork build of PR #119 kept that build's `series_alt_titles`, which every
  read failed on, so no other names showed and none were searched. It is brought to the right shape on first start.
  On any other install nothing changes, and v0.53.0 still starts.

## v0.53.0 — 2026-10-03

**Three screens that had grown cluttered are redone around what you do on them: Admin → Extensions, Health's Source
health, and a series' Edit details. Each now says first what needs you, offers one action for it, and keeps the rest
a tap away.** And the series page shows a series' banner sharp. Much of the Extensions work answers **@Kedryn**'s notes
on Discussion [#121](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/121).

### Admin → Extensions, redesigned

- **The engine at a glance.** One slim strip. **Extension engine** says *Ready*, its version and how many sources are
  on against the limit (*5 of 25 sources on*). **Cloudflare helper** says *Connected*, or offers **Connect** with one
  line on why it matters. Turning the engine off is under the strip's ⋯. When the engine is not answering or not set
  up, the tab is the setup screen, as before.
- **Installed and Browse,** two views with their counts, and **Languages** and **Check for extension updates** beside
  them.
- **Installed is one list.** While something needs you it is grouped: **Needs attention** first, with **Update all**
  and **Turn on all** in its header, then **Ready**. Each extension says at most one thing (*Update available*, *No
  source on*) and offers at most one key; the others show their languages and how many are on. The amber bars and the
  warning on every card are gone.
- **Browse reaches every extension.** On a repository of 1,300 the list stopped at the first 400 and said *narrow the
  search*, so an extension past them, MangaFire in Kedryn's case, could not be found by scrolling. Browse now shows
  60 at a time and the next ones as you scroll, to the last. Search by name and pick a language. **Show 18+
  extensions** is a switch that says what it does (a chip reading *18+* was taken for "only 18+"), and the Browse tab
  counts what the list holds. *1 repository* in the count line opens the repositories.
- **Install is one press,** with its own busy state: the extension's sources switch on and are searchable from
  Discover at once, and one with several languages then opens on them, so you can switch off the ones you don't read.
- **An extension installed in the engine's own page** arrived with every source off, and the only way on was Remove
  and Add again. Now it says *No source on* and offers **Turn on**. A language you hid stays off.
- **The extension's sheet:**
  - a switch per language (*Each language is its own source; turn on the ones you read.*), with a status under one
    only when something is wrong: failing, blocked by the site, over the source limit, or hidden in every extension;
  - the source limit, said when you are near it;
  - **Settings**, folded until you open them. *Settings for* picks whose settings you see: a language select there
    looked like it chose the language to read;
  - **Remove extension**, which asks first and says how many series came from it.
- **Languages** lists every language your extensions offer, with its sources, how many are on and how many series
  came from it, and a switch that hides it in every extension, now and in the next one you install.
- **Phones and right-to-left.** The sheets come up from the bottom and nothing scrolls sideways at 390 px; in Arabic
  names and facts keep their own direction.

### Health: Source health, sorted by what it costs you

- On a library with many extensions the card listed every source with anything to say, switched-off ones first. On
  one real library that was 31 sources turned off on purpose, each with its own Test key, under a glossary and a
  paragraph, and above the few sources its series depended on: several screens of it.
- It now leads with **Used by your series**, the most series first. Each row is one line (*Rate-limited — trying
  again in 20 minutes · 37 series*) with one key, **Test** or **Clear block**; the rest are under ⋯, and the evidence
  under *Details*.
- **Failing, used by no series** comes next, with **Turn off all**, which asks first and turns them off one by one.
- **Switched off by you** and **Nothing to fix right now** fold into one line each. The switched-off ones link to
  where each comes back on, Providers or Extensions. What the keys do, and what counts as failing, are links at the
  card's foot.
- The card's summary counts the two groups that matter: *4 sources your series use need a look · 5 sources nothing
  uses are failing*.

### Edit details, redone

- A series' **Edit details** was one long column where some fields saved at once and the rest only with a *Save
  details* key halfway down, easy to miss. It is now a dialog with tabs, **Details**, **Reading**, **New chapters**
  and **Files**, and every field saves itself, said once at the top (*Saved*), as Profile and Admin → Settings do.
- **The art is in view while you edit:** the cover and the banner as the page shows them, with **Upload** (or
  drop an image on the preview), **From a link**, **New banner** while the banner is an automatic one, and **Reset to
  automatic**. Images up to 11 MB, as it says: a picture over about 9 MB used to fail as too large.
- Status, reading direction and age rating are one-tap choices; *Always show* and *Auto-update* are switches. The
  folder paths and **Mark caught up** keep their place, under Files and New chapters. On a phone it is a sheet with
  **Art** as a tab of its own. Its words that were still English in every language are translated, and so are
  Content → Art's notices and the home page's *Because you read*.

### The series page shows its banner sharp

- A series with a real banner, AniList's or one you set, now shows it sharp at the top of its page, under the same
  shading that keeps the title readable. It was blurred, like the cover that stands in for a series with none, which
  stays blurred, because a cover stretched that wide looks rough sharp. The banner made from a series' own pages
  (v0.51.0) was sharp already. Content → Art's review tiles show a banner the way the series page does.

### Also

- A language switched on in an extension's sheet, for a source Uchiyomi had not recorded yet (one installed in the
  engine's own page), stayed off without a word. It now switches on.

### Upgrading

- **No database change.** v0.52.0 runs on the same database, and nothing changes in compose files or the environment.
- **For scripts** ([api.md](docs/api.md)):
  - `GET /api/admin/extensions/catalog` answers a page at a time: `offset` (from 0) and `limit` (default and maximum
    400, so a call with neither gets the first 400 as before), echoed beside `shown` and `matched`. It takes
    `updates=true`, `hiddenAdult` counts the 18+ extensions the other filters match (it counted the whole catalogue),
    and `adultTotal` is the whole catalogue's 18+ extensions that are not installed.
  - `POST /api/admin/extensions/catalog/:pkgName` takes `enable` beside `install`, `update` and `uninstall`: it
    switches an installed extension's sources on as its install would, answering `{ok, sources, on, hidden,
    registered}`, or 409 `no_sources`; it is audited as `extension.enable`.
  - `GET /api/admin/extensions/sources` gives each source `used`, the series that came from it, and
    `POST /api/admin/extensions/sources/bulk` records a source it has no row for and switches it as asked.
  - Health's `sources` items carry `group` (`affected`, `unused`, `quiet`, `off`), `state`, `stage`, `cooldown`,
    `offBy` and `icon`, and come in that order. The card's summary uses new codes (`sources.affected`,
    `sources.failingUnused`, `sources.working`) and a new join, `dot`.
  - `GET /img/series/:id/backdrop` takes `style=banner`: a real banner sharp, the blurred cover for a series without
    one.
  - `PUT /api/admin/series/:id/art` accepts the body of an 11 MB picture.

## v0.52.0 — 2026-10-02

**A series can now be in your library in more than one language, as editions of one work: one card in the Library,
chips to switch between them on the series page and in the reader, and in each language its own chapters, folder and
reading progress.** MangaDex serves other languages than English, one source per language, switched on in
**Admin → Providers**. And a source in another language than a series is never followed for it automatically, so a
series stays in one language. Editions are **@p3t3t3**'s request on Discussion
[#72](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/72), MangaDex's languages **@tagius**'s
([#123](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/123)), and two smaller ones are **@Kedryn**'s: full paths for
admins ([#136](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/136)) and a warning when the downloads folder sits inside
the library ([#134](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/134)).

### Language editions

Blue Lock in English and in Spanish used to be one title to Uchiyomi: Discover showed the Spanish source folded under
an *In library* card that opened the English series, and following the Spanish source from the English series mixed
the two, each chapter in whichever language won that number. Now each language is its own **edition**: a series of
its own, linked with the others as one work.

- **Each edition is a series.** Its own folder (`MangaDex (ES-419)/Blue Lock (ES-419)`, so it never lands in the
  original's), its own sources, chapters, numbering and reading progress, so reading the Spanish edition never moves
  where you are in the English one. A series added now states the language it is in, and an admin can set it for
  one already here.
- **Adding one.** *Sources & translations* has a **Languages** section that says which language the series is in and
  offers **Add a language**: pick one of the languages your sources offer, then the title there (searched under the
  series' title and its other names). An admin is pointed to MangaDex's languages in **Admin → Providers** too,
  where the one wanted may be a tap away. Or add it from Discover: a card whose title you have in another language stays
  addable and says so (*EN in library*), and picking its Spanish source offers the Spanish edition straight away. A
  source that does not say its language asks which one it is, and *It is a different series* adds it on its own.
- **One card in the Library.** A work shows once: the edition you read last, else the first one added, with every
  language under its title (*EN · ES-419*).
- **Switching.** The series page has a row of language chips under the title, and *Spanish · Ch. 12* says how far
  you are there. The reader's chapter list has the same chips: one opens the chapter you are on in the other edition,
  or that edition's page at the chapter when the server does not have it yet, with its Fetch.
- **For admins.** *Edit details* has a **Language** field (*Automatic* shows what it would be). Health's duplicate
  check counts works, not series, and a pair in two languages offers **Link as editions** instead of a merge, which
  is refused inside a work. The × in Languages unlinks an edition, which stays in the library on its own. The age
  rating and *Always show* in *Edit details* apply to every edition, so an 18+ work is 18+ in each language; and a
  viewer sees only the editions they may open.
- **Mihon, OPDS and trackers.** Komga's API (what Mihon reads) and OPDS keep the editions separate and title one
  *Blue Lock (ES-419)* while another edition is there, with its language set. The editions share their AniList,
  MyAnimeList or Kitsu entry, and reading the one that is behind never pushes your progress back.

### MangaDex in other languages

**@tagius** ([#123](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/123)) reads MangaDex in other languages than English.
MangaDex was one English source that fell back to Spanish or Portuguese for a chapter English did not have.

- **One source per language.** In **Admin → Providers**, MangaDex is one card, its languages behind **Manage**. English
  is always on; each language you tap on becomes a source of its own, *MangaDex (ES-419)* say, at once and with no
  restart, with its own Newest and Popular in Discover and its chapters in that language only. A series you add from
  it is in that language. Turning off a language that series came from asks first: they keep their chapters and get
  no new ones until it is back, and Health says which switch it is.
- **English is unchanged**, the same source with the same search and fallback, except one thing: Discover's MangaDex
  **Newest** is now the newest chapters in the language (English for English), where it used to list a title as new
  when a chapter came out in any language.
- **One rate limit for all of them.** Every MangaDex request goes through one pace, a quarter of a second apart, and
  when MangaDex asks Uchiyomi to slow down, with a 429 or by saying none are left, every language waits as long as
  it says, downloads included. A request that would wait more than ten seconds is given up rather than queued, and
  costs the source no cooldown.
- **Sites that do not say their language.** Most sites added by address, and some source packs, declare no language.
  A new setting beside **Add a site** says which language they are in: English unless you choose another.

### Every automatic follow keeps to the series' language

A Spanish source followed by an English series fills it with Spanish chapters. Now the add dialog's *Also check the
other sources*, the hunt for a missing chapter, Find other sources (automatic or reviewed) and Find missing chapters
never follow, search or offer a source in another language than the series; a source in every language counts as any
of them, and a series' own source always passes. Following one by hand from an older list is refused with both
languages named, and with **Add it as an edition**, which opens the add dialog on that language. Borrowed chapter
names come in the series' own language too.

### Full paths, for @Kedryn

- **Where a series and a chapter are on disk** ([#136](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/136)). An admin
  sees a series' folder, in full, under *Edit details* (**Folder on the server**), and a chapter's file in its ⋯ menu
  (**Copy file path**); one tap copies it and says what it copied.

### Mark caught up

- For a series already in your library, **Mark caught up** (an admin's, in *Edit details* beside Auto-update) stops
  the updater fetching what is already out, the whole back catalogue, and keeps it fetching every new chapter, as
  *Nothing yet* does for a series you add. It says what it does before it does it, and **Undo** puts back the floor
  the series had. Chapters already here stay; older ones can still be fetched from the chapter list. Asked for by
  **@p3t3t3** on [#72](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/72).

### The chapter select bar says what it removes

- The series page's select bar greyed out *Remove* until chapters were ticked, and it read as the way to remove the
  series. The bar is up from the moment you tap Select, its key says what it acts on (*Remove 3 chapters*), and with
  nothing ticked it says *Tick chapters to remove them*, beside **Remove the whole series**, the series' own Remove.

### Health: Folders scanned twice

- **@Kedryn** ([#134](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/134)) mounted his manga at `/library` with
  Uchiyomi's downloads folder inside it, so the library scan read every downloaded chapter a second time, as a series
  with no source beside the one with its source, and nothing said why. A new Health check, *Folders scanned twice*,
  warns while one folder is inside the other, by their paths or as the last scan met it, names where, and says how
  to fix it: mount them side by side. The install guide has a new
  [Volumes](docs/INSTALL.md#volumes) section with the compose lines, and the desktop app words it in its own terms.

### Also

- **Earlier searches reopen.** Each earlier Find other sources search is a key in the results sheet that opens it in
  place, *Back to the latest search* above it, so a review whose matches are still waiting is not lost once another
  search runs. A search stopped during its first series no longer reads *1 of 4 series* on the Server tasks card;
  only the series it searched count. *Skipped* has its own key for series (*Skipped series*) and for a match
  (*Skipped for good*), so Spanish, French and Portuguese agree each with what it names.
- **Shuffle on a short series.** A series of eight chapters or fewer, ten pages or fewer each, had every page read
  whatever the shuffle, so **New banner** drew the same four panels and said *Banner changed*. It now chooses among
  panels about as striking, reaches further down only when nothing near is left, and says *This is the only banner
  this series’ pages give.* when there is no other.
- **The hunt reads a chapter's parts the way updates do.** A site that numbers a chapter's parts its own way (its
  11.1 and 11.6 for your 11 and 11.5) lists that chapter, as v0.50.0 taught the updater, so the hunt for a missing part
  takes it from there at once.
- **Singulars and translations.** The last nine counts that read wrong at one in languages that agree a word with its
  number (*1 seleccionados*, *1 supprimés*) now agree: selected, deleted, saved, filed by hand, not here yet, the two
  kinds of skipped chapter, and Downloads' two delete confirmations. Still English until now, and translated: Admin →
  Extensions' paragraph, its out-of-date banner and every toast; the series page's favourite button and save notices;
  *Deleted 1 file*; *Delete 1 chapter from the server?*; and *Check for new chapters now*.
- **The desktop app's server-mode check** in CI failed now and then (macOS on v0.50.0, Windows on v0.51.0's pull
  request) while everything it printed was right. The app was fine: on a first visit the web app reloads once when its
  offline worker takes over, and the check's wait for the sign-in form could lose its grip across that reload. It
  now decides on the page that stays.

### Security updates

- `brace-expansion` 5.0.12 ([#139](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/139)), for two high-severity advisories
  and a medium-severity one, all denials of service on crafted brace patterns. The server reaches it only through
  `@fastify/static`, which expands one fixed pattern over the web app's files at start, so no request ever did.

### Upgrading

- **The database** gets one migration on first start, and it only adds: `lib_series.lang` (the language a series is
  in) and `lib_series.work_id` (the work an edition belongs to), with an index that allows one edition per language
  in a work, and `server_settings.mangadex_langs` and `unstated_lang`. A data migration then states the language of
  each MangaDex series from its own chapters, so a title that came in through English's fallback and is in Spanish
  says so. v0.51.0 still starts on a migrated database: every new column is empty or has a default, and it never
  reads them. There, a series added from a MangaDex language other than English reads *Source not installed*, kept
  rather than lost, until you come back to v0.52.0.
- **New source ids:** `mangadex-<code>` for each MangaDex language you switch on (`mangadex-es-419`,
  `mangadex-pt-br`); `mangadex` stays English.
- Nothing to change in compose files, and no new environment variables; the MangaDex languages and the language of
  sites that do not say are settings, kept in the database.
- **For scripts** ([api.md](docs/api.md)):
  - New routes: `GET /api/sources/edition-candidates?seriesId=` (the languages a series could be added in, and with
    `&lang=` the search there), `POST /api/admin/series/:id/editions` (link two series as editions) and
    `DELETE /api/admin/series/:id/edition` (unlink one).
  - `POST /api/sources/add` takes `edition: {of, lang?, ofLang?}`; its 409 `duplicate` offers `edition: {of,
    heldLangs, lang}` when the source's language is not one the library holds the title in, and it refuses with
    `edition_exists`, `edition_hidden` or `edition_lang`.
  - Series payloads carry `lang`, `workId` and `edition` (admins also `langStated`, `langAuto`, the series' `paths`
    and each chapter's `path`); `POST /api/series/search` takes `collapseEditions`; Discover's answers carry
    `libraryLangs` and each provider's `lang`, and `inLibrary` now means held in that source's language.
  - `PATCH /api/admin/series/:id` takes `lang` and `chapterFloor: 'caught_up'` (answering `{floor, previous}`), and
    a merge inside a work is refused as `same_work`. `PATCH /api/admin/settings` takes `mangadexLangs` and
    `unstatedLang`, and `GET` returns `mangadex_langs`, `unstated_lang` and `mangadex_available`.
  - A follow refused for its language answers 409 `language_differs` with `edition: {of, lang}`, from the manual
    follow and from a review's follow. `GET /api/admin/sources/find?runId=` reads an earlier run; Shuffle can answer
    `{ok: true, seed, same: true}`; Health has a new check, `folders-twice`.
  - A chapter copy's `lang` from MangaDex is the app's code (`es-419`, no longer `es-la`), as its sources are named.

## v0.51.0 — 2026-10-02

**A series AniList has no banner for now gets one made from its own pages: four striking panels from different
chapters, side by side, behind its title and in Home's carousel.** And Find other sources can show you each match
beside your series before it follows anything, with **Follow all green** for the ones it would have followed anyway.
That idea is **@TIGamingTV**'s, from issue [#132](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/132) and pull request
[#133](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/133). Plus three fixes to importing a list, for **@Kedryn**
([#121](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/121)).

### Hero banners made from a series' own pages

The banner behind a series' title, on its page and in Home's carousel, is AniList's banner art or one an admin set.
On the server this was built for, 84 of 283 series had one; the other 199 showed their cover over a blur of itself.

- **Four panels from the series itself.** For a series with no banner of its own, the server reads pages from up to
  eight chapters spread across the series, picks the four most striking crops, from four different chapters where
  it can, and sets them side by side. It looks for colour and detail, and stays away from what makes a poor banner:
  white gutters and speech bubbles (a crop more than 12 % paper white is never used), flat text boxes, lettering,
  glare, and the top and bottom of a page, where watermarks and credits sit. A chapter's first and last two pages,
  the credits and the "read it at" plugs, are never used, and a black-and-white manga is judged as one.
- **Never for 18+.** No banner is made for a series rated 18+, by its scan or by an admin, in an 18+ library,
  carrying one of the admin's 18+ genres, or from an adult source, whatever *Always show* says. A banner is shown,
  unasked, to everyone who can open the series, and an explicit panel must never become one.
- **A real banner always wins.** AniList's banner or an admin's shows as before, and an automatic one is only made
  once the AniList lookup has found none.
- **New banner.** Under *Edit details* on the series page, while its banner is an automatic one, an admin can press
  **New banner** for other chapters and other pages. The new banner is made before it replaces the old one, so a
  series whose other pages make nothing keeps the one it had.
- **The tall frame on phones.** On a phone, Home's carousel is taller than it is wide, and a strip of four would show
  the gap between the middle two panels and half of each. A phone gets the same four panels, two by two.
- **When they are made.** In the background, one at a time: 20 minutes after the server starts (10 in the desktop
  app), then daily, up to 60 series a run, ten seconds apart, standing aside for the sweep, a repair or the daily
  source check. A series you open with no banner of its own, a new one say, gets its own soon after, the same way. A
  page shows the banner once it is made and never waits for one; until then, and for a series whose pages make none
  (not tried again for a week), it looks as it did.

### Review first, for Find other sources

**@TIGamingTV** ([#132](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/132)) confirms matches by eye: one of his other
sources offered a match whose chapter count was exact and whose cover showed it was another series, and the automatic
judgement would have followed it. His pull request [#133](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/133) replaced
automatic following with a review page; here the review is an option beside it, on the same search, with two of the
pull request's rules.

- **Follow automatically, or Review first.** Every place that starts Find other sources asks which: Health's source
  row, the Library's **More**, and **Find more sources** in a series' *Sources & translations*. *Follow
  automatically* is the default and works as before, and the choice you make is remembered on that device.
- **To review.** A review-first search follows nothing. Its results list what it found under *To review*: for each
  series, your cover beside each match's, with its title, its source, its chapter count and how the numbers line up
  (*13 of our 14 chapters line up*, *We list 12 of its 14*), and **Follow** and **Skip**.
- **Green and amber.** A green match is one an automatic search would have followed. An amber one says why it needs
  a look first: it matched only under another name of the series, or a name matches exactly and the chapter numbers
  do not line up. A title that merely contains yours, with numbers that do not line up, is the shape of a sequel or a
  spin-off, and is not offered at all (#133's rule).
- **Follow all green** follows every green match, one after the other, and leaves the amber ones to follow one at a
  time. **Skip** is for good: a skipped match stays skipped.
- **Checked again when you follow.** A review can wait, so a follow checks again that the series is not numbered by
  posting order by now, and that the source is still loaded, switched on, not the series' main source and not
  followed already. A source the series already follows another way is never re-pointed (#133's other
  rule), and the cap on followed sources holds as for every follow.

### Import

From **@Kedryn**'s questions in [#121](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/121), on bringing a Mihon
library over.

- **Titles you already have no longer count toward the 500.** One import looks up at most 500 titles, and the 500
  was counted before the titles already in your library were set aside, so a backup of more than 500 imported a
  second time landed on the same first 500, by then mostly yours, and never reached the rest. Titles you have are
  listed as skipped and do not count now, and a longer list says *(first 500 not in your library kept; import again
  for the rest)*: once those are in, importing the same list again brings the next ones. A tracker list keeps its
  own limit, as before.
- **Select all “same source as before”** on the review selects the exact pairs, each backup entry found on its own
  extension at its own address, in one press.
- **Hide already imported** hides the titles your library holds, so a list brought over again shows only what is
  left to decide.

### Upgrading

- **The database** gets one migration on first start, and it only adds a table: `series_hero` (each series' banner
  seed, when its banner was made, and when a try last failed). v0.50.0 still starts on a migrated database and never
  reads it, so going back is safe. The banners themselves are files in the image cache (`CACHE_DIR`), beside the
  covers.
- Nothing to change in compose files or settings, and no new environment variables.
- **For scripts** ([api.md](docs/api.md)):
  - `GET /img/series/:id/hero` is the automatic banner (`?ar=tall` for the two-by-two frame), gated as the series'
    cover is, and **404** where there is none. Every series payload carries `autoHero`: `{seed}` once the banner is
    made, or `null`.
    `POST /api/admin/series/:id/hero/shuffle` (admin) makes a new one: `{ok: true, seed}`, or `{ok: false, error:
    'not_made'}` with the old one kept, and **409** `not_automatic` for a series that may not have one.
  - `POST /api/admin/sources/find` takes `review: true`; such a run reads `review: true`, and its series carry
    `proposals`. `POST /api/admin/sources/find/:runId/follow` and `…/dismiss`, with `{seriesId, sourceId}`, decide
    one; a follow from a review is audited as `series.follow_source` with `via: find_review`.
  - `POST /api/admin/import/batches` keeps the titles already in the library as skipped rows besides the 500 it
    looks up, so its `total` can be more than 500; `truncated` says more titles not in the library remained.

## v0.50.0 — 2026-10-02

**Following a second site no longer downloads chapters you already have: Uchiyomi compares a chapter's parts, not
just its numbers, when sites split or number them differently.** Health lists the copies that came in twice before
this release and deletes them when you say so, a card under Needs attention can be dismissed from the start, and
three pull requests from [@Squeaks72](https://github.com/Squeaks72): Previous chapter opens at the last page and
stray taps no longer skip ahead ([#129](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/129)), the 18+ filter honours a
series' own rating ([#130](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/130)), and a card in Discover for a series you
own opens it ([#131](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/131)).

### Chapter parts that sites number or split differently

A long chapter is often posted in parts, and sites do not agree on how to number them. On *Tales of Demons and Gods*
mangapill posts a chapter as 335 and 335.5, mangaread as 335.1 and 335.6; another site splits chapter 78 of *The
Great Mage Returns After 4000 Years* into ten parts, 78 and 78.1 to 78.9, where the server had it as one file. The
updater compared exact numbers, so once the main source of the server this was built for went offline and its series
followed sites like these, it took their numbers for new chapters: on 1 October it downloaded about a hundred
chapters that were already there.

- **The same parts under other numbers are the same parts.** When a site lists as many parts of a chapter as you
  have (two or more) under other numbers, they are matched in order: its 335.1 and 335.6 are your 335 and 335.5, and
  nothing is downloaded. A part you are missing is saved under your numbering. With nothing of that chapter on disk
  yet, the main source's numbering decides, then the numbering most of the series' chapters already use, so two
  sites that disagree still give you one copy of each part.
- **Another split of a chapter you have is not a new chapter.** A part a site lists at a chapter you already hold a
  file for, from a different site than that file came from, shows on the series page as *another split* (of a
  chapter you have, its tooltip says). The updater leaves it alone, it is not counted in *{n} not here yet*, and *Fetch newest* reads the series
  as up to date; the cloud icon on the row still fetches it if you want it. A part the same site lists beside the
  chapter it already gave you is part of that site's own numbering and is downloaded as before, which is how a real
  extra like 40.5 still arrives.
- **One split per new chapter.** When nothing of a chapter is here yet and two sites split it into different
  numbers of parts (540 and 540.5 on one, 540, 540.1 and 540.2 on another), only the parts of the site that comes
  first in the series' source order are downloaded; the other's show as *another site’s split*.
- **What you will see.** No more second copies after following another site, and grey rows like *78.1 · another
  split · via mangaread* under chapters you hold. Mihon does not list those rows. None of these rules touches a
  series numbered by posting order, or one whose numbering change is waiting for you.

### Health: the same chapter saved twice

- **A new check, *The same chapter saved twice*,** lists series where two sites' splits of one chapter are both on
  disk, the second having arrived after the first: 335.1 and 335.6 from mangaread beside 335 and 335.5 from
  mangapill. Each row names the files that arrived later and offers **Delete chapters** for exactly those; the
  card's **Fix all** does the same for every row, after a confirmation that lists them. It warns while it finds any,
  and nothing is deleted until you confirm. A part one site supplied under another's numbers, when that
  site lists it too, is not a second copy and is not listed. Deleted files stay listed as deleted chapters, everyone
  keeps their reading history, and updates do not fetch them back.

### Needs attention: Dismiss from the start

- A card of chapters that could not be saved, from the scheduled check or *Check now*, offered **Try again** and
  **Open**, and **Dismiss** appeared only after a *Try again* had made a download of it: the server refused to
  dismiss a card with no download behind it. Every such card now has **Dismiss** from the start, for an admin or
  whoever started the download. Dismissing a failed download no longer brings its chapters back as a card of their
  own, and a restart does not bring a dismissed card back either.

### From @Squeaks72

- **Previous chapter opens at its last page, and stray taps no longer leave a chapter**
  ([#129](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/129)). Previous chapter, the footer button and `[`, opens the
  chapter before at its last page, and a chapter whose last pages are hidden opens at its last remaining page instead
  of the first. The footer's next-chapter button asks for a second press within three seconds unless you are within
  two pages of the end; holding `[`, `]`, `f` or Escape does not repeat; a tap right after a double tap is ignored; tap
  turns can no longer overshoot, and paged mode moves one page per swipe. Merged as it was.
- **The 18+ filter honours a series' own rating** ([#130](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/130)). With
  *Show 18+* off, a series rated 18+ on its own page, or by an admin, leaves Home's *Continue reading*, the Library and
  every rail, as one in an 18+ library always did. **Always show** keeps a series on the shelf against all three: its
  library's rating, its own and its genres. The pull request also let *Always show* lift an account's age limit for
  that series, and that part was left out: *Always show* is a shelf switch in the edit dialog, and who may open a
  series stays each account's age limit. To let an account with a limit read one title, rate that title lower. The
  switch's help text says what it does, in every language.
- **A card in Discover for a series you own opens it** ([#131](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/131)). A
  card marked *In library* was a disabled button; it now opens the series in your library. The pull request's tests
  failed on something it did not touch: a test deleted a series while a background refresh was writing that series'
  chapter list, and the two deadlocked. The refresh now locks the series first, so deleting a series (*Forget*) while
  its list is being refreshed can no longer fail with "deadlock detected" either.

### Upgrading

- No database change: the stored chapter listing gains a status, `covered`, in a column it already has. Nothing to
  change in compose files or settings.
- **For scripts** ([api.md](docs/api.md)): `GET /api/series/:id/listing` can answer `why: covered`; `GET
  /api/admin/health` has a new check, `saved-twice`; `DELETE /api/sources/jobs/:folder` also dismisses a folder's
  failed chapters when the folder has no job, and dismissing a job clears them too. The search results of
  `/api/sources/search`, `search-all`, `latest` and `popular` carry `librarySeriesId` beside `inLibrary`. `adultExempt`
  on `PUT /api/admin/series/:id/meta` now also outranks a series' own 18+ rating and an 18+ library in listings; it
  does not lift `max_age_rating`.

## v0.49.2 — 2026-09-29

**The Library can be filtered by where a series comes from: Main source shows the series added from a source, and
Any source every series that reads from it, as its main source or a followed one.** Both are **@TIGamingTV**'s, from
pull request [#124](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/124), split out of
[#119](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/119) as its review asked, with a few fixes on top. Plus two
security updates to the server's dependencies.

### Main source and Any source, the Library filtered by where a series comes from

- **Two more sections in the filter panel**, in the sidebar on a laptop and in *Filters* on a phone, once the library
  has more than one source. **Main source** lists the series added from a source; **Any source** the series that read
  from it at all, as their main source or one they follow as a second source. Each source carries its count, busiest
  first, ten of them before *Show all*. A tap filters and a second tap clears; both combine with every other filter,
  live in the address like the rest, and show under the header as *Main: …* and *Any: …* chips, each cleared by its
  ×. A source whose extension is gone still filters, dimmed.
- **The counts are the grid's.** They are counted over what you may see (your libraries, the age cap, the 18+
  switch), so the number beside a source is what tapping it shows, and a source only a library closed to you uses is
  not listed at all.
- **With Find other sources**, for a source that went away: filter by it under **Main source**, then **Select** →
  **Select all** → **More** → **Find other sources** (admins). *Select all* takes what the grid has loaded, so scroll
  to the end first.

On top of the pull request:

- **The counts refresh with the grid.** After *Remove from library* or another bulk action, a pull to refresh or the
  header's refresh, the grid changed and the counts did not: they went on counting a series that had just left, until
  a reload. They refresh together now.
- **A source is named as Health names it.** A source that series only follow read as a raw id (*sw:4709…*) whenever
  the extension engine was down or the source was switched off, and a source that is not loaded could be named after
  the folder its series sit in. It now reads the name the engine gave it, as on Health and Providers.
- **Wording.** *Any source* said "a linked one"; the app says a series *follows* a second source, and keeps *linked*
  for trackers. In Japanese, *Any source* said "all sources", and the new Japanese and Chinese strings use those
  files' full-width brackets and colon. A chosen chip for a source that is not loaded keeps its highlight.

### Security updates

- `fast-uri` 4.2.1 and 3.1.8 ([#126](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/126)), for two high-severity
  advisories: authority injection and host confusion when parsing a URI. Fastify and the API reference's schema
  resolver depend on it.
- `ip-address` 10.7.2 ([#127](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/127)), for a medium-severity advisory. The
  rate limiter groups IPv6 clients with it.

### Upgrading

- No database change, and nothing to change in compose files or settings.
- **For scripts** ([api.md](docs/api.md)): a new route, `GET /api/library/sources` (`{id, name, main, any,
  installed}` for every source the viewer's library comes from), and two more conditions for
  `POST /api/series/search` on the owned backend, `mainSource` and `anySource` (`is` / `isNot` a source id).

## v0.49.1 — 2026-09-28

**When a site goes away, its series can find other sources in one press: Find other sources searches the other
sites for every series of that source, or any you pick, calmly, one series at a time, and follows the ones that
really carry them.** A series can go by other names, Health recognises a site that says it is offline, and Health
and Library → Downloads now read in your language. Plus a round of fixes to things v0.49.0 said wrong. The idea for
Find other sources, the list of other names and the way they are read from a source's description are
**@TIGamingTV**'s, from pull request [#119](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/119), rebuilt here on the
server's own search and follow rules.

### Find other sources, for every series of a site that went away

A site that goes away takes its series' new chapters with it. One Madara site has served only its own *temporarily
offline* page since 23 September; on the server this was built for, 189 of its 195 series had no second source, so
none of them has had a new chapter since. Following a second source was one series at a time, from *Find missing
chapters*.

- **Where to start it.** On **Admin → Health**, the row of a failing or switched-off source under *Source health*,
  and a row under *Series that can no longer update* whose reason is its source, carry **Find other sources (189
  series)**: every series whose main source it is. In the **Library**, select series and choose **Find other
  sources** under **More**. On a series page, **Find more sources** in *Sources & translations* does it for that one
  series. Admins only.
- **How it runs.** One run at a time on the server, in the background: one series at a time, 1.5 seconds apart,
  waiting while a chapter sweep, a library repair or the daily source check runs. For each series it searches under
  the title and up to three other names, in your source order, and never asks the series' main source, a source it
  already follows, or one that is switched off or cooling down; a series that is not 18+ never asks an 18+ source. A
  candidate passes the same check as any second source, its title and then its chapter numbers, and is followed as
  you would follow it. A series follows at most two other sources, the search stops once three sources carry it,
  and each series gets at most 90 seconds. A series numbered by posting order is skipped: it follows no other source.
- **Afterwards** each series that gained a source has its chapter list read again, 1.5 seconds apart, so the next
  scheduled check fetches its chapters without a burst, and Health checks itself again.
- **Watching and stopping.** *Server tasks* in Library → Downloads shows an *Other-source search* card: how many
  series of how many, how many sources it has followed, the series it is on or what it is waiting for, and **Stop**,
  which stops it at once. Health's row and a card under the checks show the same. It never turns the Library ring:
  it downloads nothing itself.
- **The results**, from **Show results**: *New sources* (which series got which source, and how many chapters it
  lists), *Nothing found* and why (no other source lists it under its title or other names; one did, but its title
  or chapter numbers did not match; no other source answered; no other source lists it besides the one it already
  follows), *Skipped* (numbered by posting order, already following as many sources as a series may, fewer than 3
  chapters to compare, no other source that could be asked), and *Not tried*: a stop, the 90-second limit or a
  restart cut it short (or the series was removed meanwhile), never "not found", with **Search the {n} series not
  tried**. A restart stops a run the way Stop does, and what it followed stays followed.

### Other names

- **A series keeps the other names it goes by**: its English title, a romanisation, the name another site files it
  under. They are read from its main source's description (an *Alternative Titles:* line, in Latin letters, at most
  twenty) when it is added and whenever that source's details are read, kept from a tracker import's synonyms when
  an import adds the series, and typed by an admin under **Other names** in *Sources & translations*, which says
  where each came from. A name you remove stays removed: reading the description again does not bring it back, and
  typing it again does.
- **Every search for another source uses them**: Find other sources, *Find missing chapters* (the title, up to three
  other names, then what you typed), the add dialog's check of the other sources, the nightly search for failed
  chapters and borrowed chapter names. An other name must match a candidate's title exactly, never by one
  containing the other, since a sequel's page can list its parent's name; the chapter numbers must still line up.

### "The site says it is offline"

- A site that answers with its own maintenance page (small, its title or first heading saying *temporarily
  offline*, *maintenance* or *be back soon*, with none of the site's own markup) used to parse as an empty list: the
  sweep took it for a listing with nothing new, and Health guessed *markup may not match this engine*. The built-in
  Madara and Manganato engines now recognise such a page and report it as a failure of its own. The series keep
  their chapter lists, no empty streak builds up, the step reads *the site says it is offline* on Test and in the
  source's step lines, and Health says *The site says it is offline (its own page)*, with *Wait for the site to come
  back, or find other sources for its series.* and the row's **Find other sources**.
- Discover and search put such a site in the usual cooldown (5 to 30 minutes), so the first check after it comes
  back can wait that long.

### Health and Library → Downloads in your language

- **The server's sentences are translated.** Health's summaries, notes and rows, the header's warning, a source's
  diagnosis and its fix, why a download stopped or a run ended, and a refused renumbering or extension setting were
  English in every language. The server now sends each with a code beside its English, and the page says it in your
  language: counts with their singulars, and dates and times in your own time zone, where the
  English prints UTC with no zone. A code the page does not know, from a newer server, leaves that whole line in
  English, never half of it. That is about 400 new sentences in each of the eight languages, machine-translated and
  then read by a native-level reviewer per language: corrections are still welcome.
- The pointer to removed series said *Admin → Removed*, a tab that does not exist. It says *Admin → Library*.

### Fixes

- **Last tried** on the extension engine's card is the last attempt of any kind, with how it went (*· no answer*);
  it named the last registration, which could be hours old.
- **The engine and solver rows agree.** Health's *Extension engine* row said *it can get past Cloudflare* beside the
  solver's own *Not answering*. Both read one ping now, and an engine connected to a solver that does not answer
  says so.
- **Healed chapters.** *Came in today* kept *1 chapter saved with pages missing* after the repair had filled the
  missing pages. The entry now reads as landed, after a restart too.
- **The slow archive's first chapter** of a series with nothing in the library yet is scanned in at once, and
  listed in Library → Downloads once the library holds it; such a series read *0 chapters* under a band saying *1
  of 14*.
- **The slow archive's count keeps its total.** While a chapter it had fetched was being scanned into the library,
  the cover and the series sheet could say *1 of 13* for a series of 14, until the next refresh.
- **A renumbering being applied** read *interrupted* under Health's *Chapter numbering* until it finished. It says
  it is being applied now.
- **A paused archive.** The series page no longer says a paused archive's chapters are *being archived slowly*,
  whoever is looking.
- **No lingering "running" downloads.** The 10-minute *running* line v0.49.0 removed from ordinary downloads was
  still left by a switch to your preferred group's copy, by the completion pass and by the repair's short-chapter
  step.
- Health's solver row named a newer FlareSolverr *vv3.5.2*. It has one *v* now.
- **In Arabic**, a series title in Library → Downloads (a server task's *Now:* line, a stopped download, a card under
  *Needs attention*) is cut at its own end, so its beginning shows; the ellipsis used to take its start.

### The English that was left, translated

- Admin → Extensions → Languages, the Offline page, the Library's series count, the series page's saved pages and
  notes, Discover's source count and the names the server gives devices were English in every language. They are
  translated, with their singulars, and three English sentences that read badly are reworded.

### The Library's select bar

- **Move to library**, **Remove from library** and the new **Find other sources** are rows under **More** at every
  width. As keys they took the bar to two rows at 1024 and 1280 px; it is one row from a laptop up again, in German
  too.

### CodeQL and dependencies

- The code-scanning alerts that were open are closed: six in test code, the desktop solver's debug routes answering
  only their own names, and the folder browser trimming a path's trailing slashes in one pass instead of a pattern
  that slowed down on a long run of slashes.
- framer-motion 13.4.4, Next.js 16.3.6 and Puppeteer 25.12 ([#122](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/122)).

### Upgrading

- **The database** gets one migration on first start, and it only adds two tables: `series_alt_titles` (the other
  names) and `source_find_runs` (the newest 20 runs). v0.49.0 still starts on a migrated database and never reads
  them, so going back is safe.
- Nothing to change in compose files or settings, and no new environment variables.
- **For scripts** ([api.md](docs/api.md)):
  - The English fields that Health, the downloads and the refusals send are as before, but for five sentences the
    translation review corrected: the Extension engine's summary *Turned off* is *Switched off*; `too_slow`'s reason
    reads *This source answers, but takes longer than the time it is given.*; the *Impossible chapter numbers* note
    quotes *Delete chapters* and says a bookmarked chapter is *skipped*; the *Chapter numbering* note quotes the
    Webtoons switch as *Use sequential chapter numbering*; and a source that cannot be named is *its source* inside
    a sentence. Beside each field, a `…Said` field carries its code: `summarySaid`, `noteSaid`, `detailSaid`,
    `titleSaid`, `fixSaid`, `reasonSaid`, `messageSaid` and `errorSaid` (the `Said` schema in openapi.yaml), and
    `noteCode` on the public source list.
  - New routes: `GET` and `POST /api/admin/series/{id}/alt-titles`, `DELETE /api/admin/series/{id}/alt-titles/{norm}`,
    `GET` and `POST /api/admin/sources/find` and `POST /api/admin/sources/find/stop`. A run's `results[].why` is one
    of `posting_order`, `full`, `too_few`, `no_source`, `refused`, `no_answer`, `followed_already`, `no_match` and
    `not_tried`.
  - `GET /api/sources/jobs` carries admins a `find_sources` run card, with `followed` and `waiting`. Health's
    `sources` and `frozen-series` rows can carry the action `find_sources` with `findSeries`. A stage's `kind`, a
    Test check's `kind` and a diagnosis `code` can be `site_offline`, whose fix has the code `fix.siteOffline`.
  - `GET /api/admin/extensions/status` adds `lastTry` and `lastTryOk`, and the `archive` of
    `GET /api/series/{id}/listing` adds `pausedForAll`.

## v0.49.0 — 2026-09-28

**Server downloads get a home of their own, Health says what every fix does and whether it worked, a failing
source shows as failing, a whole series can come in slowly over nights or days, a source that gives many
different posts one chapter number is numbered in posting order, and the extension engine is easy to add and
remove.** Plus Health's keys, the status marks and the messages lose their capsule shapes: messages are cards at
the bottom that never cover a dialog's title.
[#115](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/115) was reported by **@TIGamingTV**, with the screenshots
that showed it; [#116](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/116) and

**@TIGamingTV**'s reply on Discussion [#72](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/72).

### Library → Downloads: everything the server fetches, in one place

The downloads pill in the bottom corner is gone, and so is the *On the server* section v0.48.1 put on the
Offline tab. Everything the server fetches, whoever started it, is under **Library → Downloads**:

- **A ring on the Library tab.** While chapters come in, the Library tab's icon on a phone wears a thin ring
  that fills as they land, with a small count of the series being fetched; on a computer the same ring is the
  cloud button just before the Updates bell. An amber dot on it means a download failed — one of yours, or any,
  for an admin.
- **Series | Downloads**, a switch under the Library page's title. The address remembers which
  (`/library/?view=downloads`), so Back and a shared link land on the same one.
- **Each series as its cover with a ring**, like an app being installed, in up to five sections: **Running now**,
  **Queued** (waiting their turn at a busy source, and the slow archive below), **Needs attention** (a failed
  download, with **Try again**, which fetches exactly the chapters it did not land, **Dismiss** and **Open**),
  **Server tasks** (the scheduled check, the library repair with the step it is on, a bulk *Fetch newest*) and
  **Came in today**, which now survives a restart of the server.
- **Each series page** shows its own downloads in a slim band above the chapter list, whoever started them, with
  a Cancel when it is yours to stop. Grey chapters turn into chapters as they land.
- Discover's strip, the add dialog's *Open in library*, the command palette (*Server downloads*) and the desktop
  app's old `/downloads` link all lead there.

**The Offline tab is this device's again**: only the copies saved here for reading with no connection, and one
line pointing to Library → Downloads. The reader's button to it says *Offline*, and the profile's section is
*Offline downloads*.

**Who sees which download.** Everyone sees the downloads of the series they can open: library access, age cap and
the 18+ hide, the rule the series themselves follow. Before, downloads were filtered only while the 18+ hide was
on, so a member shut out of a library still received the titles of what it was downloading. A failed download is
shown only to whoever started it and to admins, and only they can dismiss it; before, any member could clear
anyone's. Members who may not add series see none of it: no ring, no switch.

### Messages are cards at the bottom, and statuses and Health's keys are no longer capsules

- **Messages** (*Marked read*, *Fetching 3 chapters…*, *Could not save*) were capsules at the top of the screen for
  3.2 seconds whatever they said. On a phone that is where every dialog keeps its title, and a long error was gone
  before it was read. They are now small cards at the bottom: just above the bottom bar on a phone (above the
  select bar in select mode; in the bar's own place while a dialog is open, so the dialog is never covered), above
  the reader's chapter list and settings sheet, and in the bottom-right corner on a laptop (bottom-left in
  Arabic). A message stays as long as it takes to read — longer for longer ones, at least six seconds for an
  error — and waits while you hover over it, touch it or tab to it. ✕ dismisses it, and so does a swipe down; the
  same message twice shows once with *×2*, and at most three show at once.
- **Statuses are a mark and words.** The capsules on Health (*All good*, *Worth a look*), the source cards'
  `ok` / `rate-limited` and the engine's `ready` are a shaped glyph with words: *Healthy*, *Rate-limited*, *Not
  answering*, *Answers empty*, *Turned off*, *Blocked by the site*, *Failing*, *Engine ready*. The shapes differ,
  so a status reads without its colour; the source capsule used to print the server's own word, in English, in
  every language.
- **Buttons are keys.** Health's action chips and the buttons on Providers and Extensions are rectangular keys.
  Filter and sort chips stay as they are. The Updates bell's count is a small squared tag.
- **Motion.** Progress rings stop turning under **Reduce effects** or the system's reduce-motion setting and show a
  still dashed circle instead; messages then neither slide in nor show the line that drains as their time runs out.
- **Translations.** Thirty strings that had shipped in English in every language are translated (the reader's
  repeated-page controls, removing a Moment, the offline banner, *Saved for offline*, among others), times such
  as *3 days ago* are said in your language, and Health and Tasks are translated too: titles, actions, schedules
  and results (a finding's own sentence from the server is still in English).

### Health: what each fix does, how long it takes, and whether it worked

You could not tell from **Admin → Health** what a button would do, how, how long it would take, or whether it had
worked. The answers were in the code and nowhere on the page.

- **Before you press.** Each card opens with what you can do there: one line per action saying what it does,
  *How it works* for the detail, and how long it takes — *Usually 40 sec · At most about 3 min of searching and
  waiting · plus at most 20 chapter downloads*. "Usually" is the middle of the last five runs of the same kind;
  "at most" adds up only the waits the code limits, and downloads are a count, never turned into a time.
- **While it runs.** The finding you pressed shows the step, what it is on and a ticking clock, and its card's
  header a small working mark. A strip at the top of Health follows any repair — yours, another admin's, the
  nightly: the step, the series or chapter it is on, how long it has been going, how long it usually takes and the
  searches it has left, with **Stop**. A key that would start a repair waits while a chapter sweep or another
  repair runs, and says why, instead of being refused after the press.
- **Afterwards.** The row keeps what the run did and *Took m:ss*, or why it was refused or failed, and it is still
  there after a reload. The page checks itself again when the run **ends**; the v0.48 buttons re-checked the
  moment they were pressed, when the repair had only just begun. **Recent repairs**, at the bottom, keeps the
  runs, nightly and pressed alike: who, what, how long, what it did and what it passed over, and why (*Skipped:
  its folder is busy with another download*).
- **Fix all issues** is a row at the top. Its plan, with each step's limits, is under *How it works* before you
  press **Start**, where the old confirmation showed it only afterwards, and it now says what it does: its solver
  step ends the cooldowns of the sources that blame the solver, and the gap and short-chapter steps share one
  budget of searches.
- **A fix on one row no longer replaces the nightly's line.** A *Fix* on one chapter used to overwrite **Admin →
  Tasks → Repair library** and, after a restart, move the nightly's schedule. That line is now always the last full
  run, marked *(nightly)* or *(run by hand)*, followed by when the next one is due, the running step with its clock,
  and the latest one-off fix, which links to Recent repairs.
- **Keys that do what they say.** *Fill now* works on a series whose automatic updates are off, and fetches the
  missing chapters a source it already follows lists (up to 20) instead of leaving them to the next sweep. *Fix*
  is no longer offered for a chapter saved with placeholder pages, where it did nothing. The *Chapters that would
  not download* card's Fix all gives every failed chapter another try now and re-checks up to ten series at once,
  from the sources that can be asked; it used to reset only week-old ones and re-check nothing.
  The solver reset is one action on its card that says how many sources it reaches (*Reset the solver (3
  sources)*) and that it cannot restart the solver; while the solver is not answering, the card says to restart it
  instead. A row says before the press what an action cannot do (*Updates are paused for this series: Fill now
  fetches the missing chapters once*, *This source is cooling down…*), and *Failing since* survives a Retry now.
- **Scans say what they found.** **Scan the library now**, on the *Library scan* and *Downloads missing from the
  library* cards, and the admin home's *Scan library now* answer *Scan done: 38 series, 912 chapters* (or that a
  scan ran less than a minute ago) and check Health again. The warning in the header clears by itself once a
  repair, a test or a scan has fixed what it was about.

### A failing source shows as failing (#115)

"Manga Ball (EN)" failed its **Test** while its Providers card said `ok` and Health said *All good*. The Test wrote
nothing down, the daily check wrote a code that nothing read, and Health read only the status that any finished
download puts back to `ok`. The diagnosis also blamed the extension engine (*The extension server did not
answer*), though the engine had answered, with the extension's own error.

- **What each step did is kept.** A source is checked in four steps — search, chapter list, page list and images
  (the Test and the daily check try the first three; images are seen when chapters download) — and Uchiyomi now
  keeps what each was last seen doing, and who saw it: the Test button, the daily check, or ordinary use. A failed
  Test or daily check marks that step failing at once; ordinary use does after three failures in a row at the same
  step. Only a later success at that **same** step clears it, so a downloaded chapter no longer vouches for a
  broken search. Testing still never changes a cooldown.
- **Providers and Health say which step broke.** The source's card reads **Failing** — a step failed its last Test
  or daily check, or three times in a row in normal use, within the last week and while nothing has put the source
  in a cooldown — with a line per step (✗ Search, when, and whether the Test button, the daily check or normal use
  saw it) and the engine's own error, and it keeps them after a reload. Health's *Source health* names each source
  and leads with the step (*Search failing since …*). A source no series uses counts as soon as its failure is
  confirmed; turn it off or *Ignore* it, and it comes back only if another step starts failing. *All sources
  responding normally* is never said over a failing source, or one whose test could not finish.
- **The engine is told apart from the extension.** *The extension server did not answer* now means only that the
  engine could not be reached, timed out or refused Uchiyomi's login (that one now says to set
  `SUWAYOMI_USERNAME` / `SUWAYOMI_PASSWORD`). When the engine answers with the extension's own error, it reads
  *This source's extension reported an error*, with what to try; a source that lists chapters without numbers
  says that. *Working normally.* is never shown under a failed check.
- **A fairer test.** It tries up to three search results before blaming a chapter list, asks for the pages of the
  newest chapter first, and keeps every call inside its own time limit (`SOURCE_TEST_TIMEOUT_MS`): running out of
  time reads *could not finish in time — not proof it is broken*, never *failing*. The Test key counts against that
  limit (*Testing… 0:12 of up to 0:53*).
- **Check all now runs in the background**, with its progress on the button (*Checking 7 of 40 · …*), and picks up
  a check that was already running when you open Providers.
- **One push per new failure.** The daily check notifies admins of every failure it confirms (a rate limit
  aside), not only a short list of known causes, and once per new or changed failure rather than every morning;
  the notification opens Health.

### The extension engine: easy to add, remove and wire up (#72)

It stays what it was, an optional second container beside the one image; what changes is that adding it, removing
it and pointing it at the Cloudflare solver are no longer chores, on any platform.

- **One switch on Docker Compose.** `EXTENSION_ENGINE=0` in `.env`, then `docker compose up -d`: the engine's
  container goes, its data stays in its volume, and Uchiyomi knows extensions are off instead of reporting an
  engine that isn't answering. Delete the line and run the same command to bring it back where it left off. It
  needs the v0.49.0 compose files (see Upgrading).
- **Unraid and CasaOS.** Unraid gets a template for the engine, **uchiyomi-suwayomi** in Apps (pinned,
  memory-capped, and its Cloudflare helper ready once you enter your FlareSolverr's address, or press
  **Connect**); CasaOS gets an add-on,
  [`deploy/casaos/uchiyomi-suwayomi.yml`](deploy/casaos/uchiyomi-suwayomi.yml), that joins the listing's network
  and uses its solver. On Umbrel it is not available: an Umbrel app cannot offer an optional second container.
- **Setup steps where you need them.** With no engine — switched off, not set up, or not answering —
  **Admin → Extensions** says which, and shows the steps for your platform (Docker Compose, Unraid, CasaOS, Umbrel
  or somewhere else) with each command ready to copy. **Check again** asks at once, and the card turns into the
  extension catalogue by itself when the engine answers. It warns you never to delete the engine's data, and says
  how many series depend on it.
- **Uchiyomi keeps trying.** It stopped asking about four minutes after a failed start, so an engine that came up
  later — a slow NAS, a template installed after Uchiyomi, a container restarted by hand — stayed missing until
  someone reloaded. It now asks every 5 minutes for as long as it takes, quietly, and registers the engine's
  sources the moment it answers; a *Reload sources* during an outage heals the same way.
- **Health has one *Extension engine* row**: off (a greyed line while series depend on it), not answering (and how
  often it has asked), or ready, and whether the engine's own Cloudflare helper is in use. Series from extensions
  that cannot update say *…can't be reached because the extension engine isn't answering* (or *is off*) instead of
  "over the source limit".
- **The engine's Cloudflare helper, connected with one press.** When the engine's own helper is off, or points at
  `localhost` where no helper runs, **Admin → Extensions** says so under the catalogue, and Health's row says the
  same, amber while an extension source is seen behind Cloudflare. Both offer **Connect**, which sets the engine to
  the solver Uchiyomi uses (`FLARESOLVERR_URL`), with nothing restarted. When the engine cannot say what its helper
  is set to while a source fails with the engine's own *Cloudflare bypass currently disabled*, the row reads *It
  cannot use its Cloudflare helper*, with the same key wherever there is a setting to change.
- **The engine's page cache is kept empty.** The engine keeps a copy of every page it serves, with no limit,
  inside its container, which on the host means the system disk: on one server it had grown to 17 GB and filled
  it. Uchiyomi already has those pages in the chapter files it wrote, so it asks the engine to delete them after
  each extension download job and every half hour while nothing downloads through it, never while an extension
  download is running. Covers are left alone, and no compose change is needed.
- **The engine's data is not in Uchiyomi's backup**, on purpose: it belongs to another container, and a copy taken
  while it runs may not be consistent. [extensions.md](docs/extensions.md#your-engines-data) has a three-line recipe
  for backing it up, and [MIGRATING.md](docs/MIGRATING.md#adding-or-removing-the-extension-engine) how to move it
  between setups.

### The slow archive: a whole series over nights or days (#117, @Jamie96ITS)

A back catalogue came down in one go — *All* in the add dialog, *Fetch all 900* on a series — and a burst like that
is how a site learns to refuse you. It can now come in the way a person reads: a chapter at a time, with pauses no
script would take, over nights or days, and a restart never loses its place.

- **Where you start it.** **Archive the rest slowly**, a switch in the add dialog under *Chapters to fetch now*
  (with *First N*, *Latest N* or *Nothing yet*; *All* leaves no rest), says how many chapters come in, in which
  order and about how long that takes at the current pace; the dialog's warning about grabbing many chapters at
  once now suggests it. On a series page, **Archive slowly** sits in its actions and beside *Fetch all* on the line
  of older chapters. It is in a cover's menu too, and in the Library's select bar for many series at once (a key on
  a laptop, under **More** on a phone). Admins and members who may download can queue a series they can open, as
  long as every source it follows is inside their age limit.
- **How slowly.** By default four chapters an hour from each site: one page at a time, a random 1.5 to 4 s between
  pages, a break drawn at random after each chapter, and now and then a long one of 20 to 45 minutes. That comes to
  about 96 chapters a day from one site, so 1,000 take about ten days. Several sites are archived side by side (at
  most three at once), and the series queued on one site take turns.
- **It stands aside** for the scheduled check, the library repair, the daily source check and *Check all now*, for
  anybody else's download from the same site or of the same series, and for a site's own cooldown. A site that
  refuses a chapter (403 or 429) is left alone for an hour, then three, then twelve, then a day at a time, and the
  series stays queued; a chapter list that cannot be read is asked for again on the same ladder, never every minute.
- **A restart keeps its place and its breaks.** What is still missing is worked out afresh at every turn, from the
  series' chapter list and what the library holds, so there is nothing to reconcile; and the next start on a site
  is written down before each chapter begins, so neither a restart nor a crash loop can shorten a break. The first
  look waits ten minutes after the server starts.
- **It never goes looking.** It fetches only from the sources a series already follows, and never searches other
  sites or follows new ones. Its chapters are not news either: they do not count under Updates, send no push
  notification and stay out of the digests.
- **Where you watch it.** Library → Downloads, under **Queued**: each archived series is its cover under a still
  amber ring with an hourglass, *120 of 900* and about how long is left. Tap it for what it is doing (*Next chapter
  in 12 minutes*, *A chapter failed on its site; trying again in 2 hours*), which way it fills, the space it will
  still take and what failed so far, with **Pause**, **Resume** and **Stop archiving** for whoever queued it and for
  admins, and **Open series**; admins also get **Pause all** / **Resume all**. The Library ring never turns for it:
  while an archive is the only thing working, the ring is the same still, amber mark. **Needs attention** lists an
  archive whose site keeps refusing, whose source has been missing or switched off for a day, that waits for disk
  space, that has been paused for a week or has had its turns for three days with nothing coming in, and one that
  finished with chapters it could not fetch, with why (*3 chapters failed too many times*). *Came in today* sums up
  its chapters per series (*Slow archive: 12 chapters today*). On the series page the band above the chapter list
  shows the archive with the same keys, and the grey rows it is about to fetch fold into one line, *Ch. 121–900 ·
  780 chapters being archived slowly*. Health does not report the gaps an archive is filling as problems, and **Fill
  now** there still fetches them at once, at the usual pace.
- **How it shares the work with the scheduled check.** The archive owns the chapters listed when it was queued (on
  a *Latest N* series, those below its floor); the check keeps taking everything newer. A series' own *Latest N*
  floor is never changed while it runs, and finishing lifts it only if nobody has changed it meanwhile. **Stop
  archiving** keeps what came in and leaves the rest where it was before: under a *Latest N* or *Nothing yet* floor
  it waits for you, otherwise the scheduled check fetches it at its own pace.
- **Admin → Settings → Downloads** holds the pace: *Slow archive* (off pauses every archive and keeps the queue),
  *Chapters an hour, per source* (1–30, with what that comes to a day), *Only during set hours* (in the server's
  local time; 22 until 6 runs overnight) and *Stop when free space is below (GB)* (20 by default, with the space free
  now; chapters you fetch yourself are not held to it). Every change applies at once.
- **On the desktop app** it runs only while Uchiyomi is open, the tray included, and never keeps the computer awake;
  its first look waits three minutes after the app starts.

### Chapters numbered in the order they were posted (#116, @Jamie96ITS)

The Webtoons extension gives a post the number of the first *ep* or *ch* in its title, and a post with neither the
previous number plus 0.01. A series posted in parts therefore gives many different posts one number: Istrevelia's
226 posts land on 13 numbers, 73 of them on 7, and Apocalyptic Horseplay's 211 on 19, because the number it finds
is the arc's. Uchiyomi knows a chapter by its number, so every post after the first on a number became a *version*
of it: 226 posts read as 13 chapters, with dozens of versions under some of them.

- **Such a source is noticed**, for each series and each source on its own: at least 12 posts, at least half of
  them beyond the first on their number within one group, and one number carrying five or more posts under at
  least three different names. Several groups' copies of one chapter (MangaDex), a mirror posted twice the same
  day, and an unnamed *Chapter 5* beside *Chapter 5: The Return* do not count. A listing that looks like this but
  cannot say in which order its posts came only gets a warning.
- **It is then numbered by posting order**: 1 to 226, oldest first — what the extension's own *Use sequential
  chapter numbering* switch gives — and the numbers are kept. A post the creator deletes leaves a hole instead of
  renaming every chapter after it, and one inserted later takes a number between its neighbours (41.5). Everything
  reads the same numbers: the files (`Chapter 20.cbz`), the grey rows, versions, *Find missing chapters*, floors,
  read marks and trackers.
- **New series are numbered as they are added.** The add dialog says so — *Numbered by posting order*, with *226
  chapters by posting order · 13 by the source's own numbers* — and **Keep the source's numbers** adds it the old
  way (*Keeping the source's own numbers*). On a weaker sign (*Some posts share a chapter number*) it offers
  **Number by posting order** instead.
- **A series already in your library is never renamed without you.** Its page says *Chapter numbers need a review*,
  and nothing new downloads for it until an admin opens **Review renumbering**: every file on disk, the number it
  has, the number it gets and the post it was matched to, anything that could not be matched (kept, at a free
  number just after the chapter before it), and whether a tracker is linked. **Rename the files** renames them in
  place and keeps each chapter's row, so reading progress, bookmarks and notes stay where they were; **Keep the
  source's numbers** leaves everything as it is and lets the series update again. The renaming is written down
  before the first file moves and done in two passes, so a crash half-way is finished by the next check.
- **Going back.** **Use the source's numbers** on the series page undoes it the same way, after the same review,
  and keeps every file: posts that share a number again become `Chapter 7.cbz`, `Chapter 7 (2).cbz` and so on. A
  choice an admin makes is never undone by the detector.
- **While a series is numbered by posting order** it takes its chapters from that source alone. Another site
  numbers the same posts its own way, so following another source, searching other sites for its gaps, borrowing
  chapter names and filling from elsewhere are refused, with that reason.
- **An extension's own settings**, from **Settings** beside an installed extension in **Admin → Extensions**: the
  screen Mihon shows for it, one language at a time, the Webtoons extension's *Use sequential chapter numbering*
  among them. A setting that changes the chapter numbers a source gives says so in its own row, asks again when
  series in your library use those numbers, and then holds each of those series for a review on its page — nothing
  is renamed until an admin confirms. Series numbered by posting order are not affected.
- **Versions** show each copy's own title — twenty identical `—` rows under one number were how #116 looked — and
  say when copies look like different posts that share a number rather than versions of one chapter.
- **Health** has a *Chapter numbering* check: the series waiting for a renumbering review, with the same review and
  **Keep the source's numbers**, and a renumbering still being finished; greyed, the series Uchiyomi numbered by
  posting order on its own in the last two weeks.
- **Trackers** are told the highest chapter you finished rounded down, so a finished 12.6 no longer reports 13.
- The built-in **Madara** and **Manganato** engines keep one post per number and drop the rest before anything can
  see them, so this cannot help there; that is unchanged.

### Upgrading

- **The database** gets one migration on first start, and it only adds: new tables (`download_log`,
  `repair_runs`, `series_post_numbers`, `archive_queue`, `archive_pace`) and new columns that are nullable or have
  a default. v0.48.4 still starts on a migrated database, so going back to it is safe — with the one exception
  under chapter numbering below.
- **Docker Compose: download your compose file again to get the engine switch.** Updating the image does not change
  your compose file. Fetch the one for your layout —
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/main/deploy/docker-compose.yml`, or
  `docker-compose.external-db.yml` or `docker-compose.split.yml` from the same folder; each has the switch — or add
  its two lines to yours ([MIGRATING.md](docs/MIGRATING.md#adding-or-removing-the-extension-engine)). ⚠️ Check
  which one you run first: an install made before v0.18.0 may run the external-database layout (with a
  `uchiyomi-db` container) under the name `docker-compose.yml`, and the one-container file in its place starts on a
  new, empty database. `EXTENSION_ENGINE` only takes `0` or `1`: it is the engine's replica count, and any other
  value stops `docker compose up` for the whole stack.
- ⚠️ **An empty `SUWAYOMI_URL=` now turns extensions off.** The old compose files wrote `${SUWAYOMI_URL:-…}`,
  which puts the default back for an empty value, so the documented off switch never worked, and a `SUWAYOMI_URL=`
  line in `.env` did nothing. The v0.49.0 files take it at its word. If your `.env` has such a line and you use
  extensions, delete it before switching files.
- **The Offline tab** lists only the chapters saved on that device; what the server fetches is under
  **Library → Downloads**.
- **Chapter numbering applies by itself only to series you add from now on.** A series already in your library
  that a source numbers this way is held — nothing new downloads for it — until an admin reviews its plan on the
  series page (or under Health's *Chapter numbering*) and applies it, or keeps the source's numbers. The one
  exception is a series with no chapters on the server yet (a *Nothing yet* add, say): there is nothing to rename,
  so its next check numbers it by posting order without asking. Applying a plan renames the files and keeps every
  chapter's row: ids, reading progress, bookmarks and notes. **Use the source's numbers** renames them back; going
  back to v0.48.4 does not. v0.48.4 does not know the new numbers: it reads that source's own numbers again, so most
  new posts look like chapters it already has, and the few the source numbers N.01 may be fetched a second time.
  Before going back, press **Use the source's numbers** on every series numbered by posting order, whether it was
  added that way or renumbered.
- **Chapter names filled in before v0.49.0 count as a match.** Since v0.46.0 Uchiyomi has filled in a chapter's
  missing name from the source's chapter list. From v0.49.0 on, such a name is marked as copied, so the renumbering
  never takes it as proof of which post a file is. A name filled in before then carries no mark: for those chapters
  a match by name counts, as a name the file came with does. Their plan does not point them out as matched only by
  the old chapter list, and an extension setting that changes the source's numbers without moving any file settles
  by itself. Look at those chapters' matches in the plan before you confirm.
- **Extension settings**: changing one that renumbers a source (the Webtoons extension's *Use sequential chapter
  numbering*) holds every series from that source that uses its numbers until an admin reviews each on its page.
- **The slow archive starts with nothing queued.** Its defaults: 4 chapters an hour per source, no time window, and
  it waits while less than 20 GB is free under the download folder (the downloader's own floor stays at
  `MIN_FREE_GB`, 10 GB). On the desktop app it runs only while the app is open. `ARCHIVE_PAGE_GAP_MS` and
  `ARCHIVE_MAX_SOURCES` shape its pace underneath ([CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#the-slow-archive)).
- **Sources on the built-in Madara and Manganato engines** drop the posts that share a number before Uchiyomi sees
  them, so posting-order numbering cannot help there. That is not changed in this release.
- **For scripts** ([api.md](docs/api.md)):
  - `GET /api/admin/tasks`: the repair's `lastRun` and `lastResult` are now the last **full** run (the nightly, or
    Tasks → Run now). A fix pressed on one Health row is in `GET /api/admin/tasks/repair/runs` and the row's new
    `latestOther`.
  - `GET /api/sources/jobs` hands each viewer only the downloads of series they can browse, and a failed one only
    to whoever started it and to admins. `DELETE /api/sources/jobs/<folder>` answers **403** to anyone else, and
    **404**, as Cancel does, for a download the caller is not shown.
  - `POST /api/admin/sources/check` answers **202** at once and runs in the background: the verdicts are in
    `GET /api/admin/sources/check` once `running` is false.
  - `POST /api/admin/update` runs as the scheduled sweep does: **409** `busy` while a sweep or a library repair
    runs, and **500** when the sweep itself fails.
  - `POST /api/sources/fetch` and `POST /api/sources/fill` answer **409** `renumber_pending` while a series waits
    for its renumbering; a fill from another source into a series numbered by posting order, and following one for
    it (`POST /api/admin/series/:id/sources`), answer **409** `posting_order`.
  - Everything else only adds fields and routes (api.md has them), among them: the repair run's id in its answer,
    `GET /api/admin/tasks/repair/status` and `/runs`, Health's `outcome`, `caveats`, source evidence and `numbering`
    check (with its `renumber` and `keep_numbers` actions), the Test's `state` and `stage`, `live`, `failing`,
    `evidence` and `testMs` on `GET /api/admin/sources`, the `progress` on the source check's 409, the scan's counts
    on `POST /api/refresh` (to an admin), the job cards' `left`, `origin` and `cover`,
    `POST /api/admin/extensions/solver`, the slow archive's routes and its `archive` objects, `archive` and
    `numbering` on `POST /api/sources/add`, the numbering and extension-settings routes, and `numbering` on the
    detail and the listing.

## v0.48.4 — 2026-09-26

**Find missing chapters no longer fails on slow sources.**

### Find missing chapters shows each source as it answers

Find missing chapters asked every source and waited for the slowest before showing anything. A source behind
Cloudflare can take a minute and a half to answer, so on a library that comes mostly from such sources a scan
took up to three minutes. A reverse proxy in front of Uchiyomi usually ends it first (nginx gives up after 60
seconds unless told otherwise), and the dialog said *The scan failed.* The ☁ on a ghost chapter, which asks only
the series' own sources, kept working, which made it look like the scan was broken rather than slow.

Now the dialog shows each source as soon as it answers, the series' own source first, and says which ones it is
still waiting for. Nothing waits on the slowest source any more, so no proxy's timeout applies, and a source's
chapters can be downloaded from the moment its card appears.

### Upgrading

Nothing to do. If you raised a proxy timeout to get the scan through, you can put it back.

## v0.48.3 — 2026-09-26

**The Health page does what it says, and Find missing chapters downloads what it finds.**

### Health findings you can open, fix all at once, or ignore

- **Open takes you to the chapter.** It went to the home screen for every finding (fixed in v0.48.2), and even
  pointed right it only named the series. A short chapter now opens in the reader; a gap or an impossible chapter
  number opens the series with the chapter list turned to that page and the row lit up for a moment — for a gap,
  the chapter just before it, where it begins. A duplicate gets an Open for each copy.
- **Fix all issues**, once, for the whole page. It runs the repair with every step that has something to do —
  looking for longer copies of short chapters, filling gaps, and trying every source's failed chapters again
  now — after a confirmation that says how much one run takes on and that it never deletes, merges, unblocks or
  switches anything off. The page checks itself again when the run ends, not when you press the button.
- **Ignore** a finding and it stops warning you: the row stays on its card, greyed, with *Stop ignoring*, and
  leaves the check (and the warning in the header) alone. It stays quiet while nothing new is part of it — a gap
  that gets smaller stays ignored, a newly missing chapter brings it back — and an ignore whose finding has been
  gone for a week is forgotten, so a problem that comes back later is news again. Short chapters keep their own
  *It's fine*, which does the same.
- **A header warning you dismissed stays dismissed** when a check goes quiet — fixed, or its last finding
  ignored. It came back whenever the set of checks with findings changed at all; now only a new problem, or one
  getting worse, brings it back.
- **That warning no longer covers dialogs.** It was drawn over every open dialog; on a phone it hid the title
  and close button of a tall one, such as Find missing chapters.
- The admin console's header says "1 chapter behind" rather than "1 chapters behind across 1 series", and says
  it in your language; that line was English in every language.

### Find missing chapters downloads what it finds

It only offered to follow a source for the chapters after your last one, and following downloads nothing until
the next scheduled check — then five at a time. Now every source that has chapters you lack, gaps and newer ones
alike, shows them as a picker: runs of chapters as chips, all selected, *⋯* to choose one by one. One press
downloads the selection now — from the series' own source or one it follows, taking the best copy of each chapter
across them, or, for a source it does not follow yet, *Follow and download* (admins). Following on its own lists
the source's chapters on the series page at once, and says that new ones come with the checks.

One chapter now reads as one chapter: the ☁ on a single ghost chapter said *Fetching 1 chapters…*, and so did
the dialog's buttons and counts.

### Upgrading

Nothing to do. One new table (`health_ignored`) is created on start.

## v0.48.2 — 2026-09-26

**Downloads that never reached the library, found for real this time (#109), and automatic checks on Unraid.**

### Downloads that never reached the library

v0.48.0 fixed one way a download could stay out of the library — a folder the database refused, which stopped
the whole scan — and reported it. On Unraid it kept happening, with the Health page saying all was well.
Reported by @ZukiFen and @Maaster.

- **The scan skipped folders it thought it had already seen.** To guard against loops it remembered every
  folder's disk id, and passed over any folder whose id it had met before, with everything inside it. On
  Unraid's user shares (`/mnt/user`) folders on different disks can report the same id, so some series — always
  the same ones — never reached the library however often it was scanned, and moving the folder into the library
  folder "fixed" it. A folder is now passed over only when it really is one of the folders above it again, which
  is the only way the scan can loop; everything else is scanned. *Health → Library scan* says how many folders
  share an id, so a screenshot shows whether an install was hit.
- **One entry could hide a whole folder.** On a filesystem that does not say what each entry is (many network
  and FUSE mounts), one entry the scan could not check — a name that is not valid text, a file renamed mid-scan —
  made it read the whole folder as empty. Now only that entry is left out, and it is named.
- **A folder the scan cannot read is named** on *Health → Library scan*, instead of being passed over in silence.
- **A title that starts with a dot** (`.hack//Link`) was downloaded into a folder the scan treats as hidden. New
  downloads no longer start with one.

### Nothing goes missing quietly any more

- **Health → Downloads missing from the library** compares every chapter file in the downloads folder with the
  library and lists each one that is not in it, per folder, with the reason when it can tell, and which kind of
  filesystem the folder is on. It does not depend on the scan having noticed, which is exactly what failed twice.
  The six-hourly check includes it, so the admin warning comes up by itself. A file of your own that the scan never
  reads as a chapter (straight in the downloads folder, say) is listed but never turns it red.
- **An add or a Fetch whose chapters land on disk but not in the library ends as an error that says so**, not
  "done". v0.48.0 only checked the chapters that were already on disk.
- **Scans no longer overlap.** A scan asked for while one is running waits for one more after it, so a chapter
  that just landed is always included. *Refresh* started one full scan per library, all at the same time.

### Unraid and all-in-one installs: the automatic checks now run

The scheduled check for new chapters and the nightly repair only started when `LIBRARY_BACKEND=owned` was set.
The compose files set it; the all-in-one image and the Unraid template don't, so on those installs a followed
series was only ever checked when someone pressed *Run now*. Both now start on every install. **After updating,
the first check runs within about ten minutes of the server starting** (or six hours after one you ran by hand)
and fetches what your followed series are missing, within the usual limits: up to 5 new chapters per series and
150 downloads per check. The nightly repair runs within half an hour (or a day after one you ran by hand).

### Also

- **Open on the Health page opens the series** it names. It went to the home screen.

### Upgrading

Nothing to do: no database changes.

## v0.48.1 — 2026-09-26

**See everything the server downloads, and a way out of a previewed chapter on a phone.**

### Everything the server downloads, in one place

The downloads pill only ever showed what a button started — in practice, an add from Discover. Chapters from a
source you followed through *Find missing chapters* arrive at the series' next check; the scheduled check
downloads for every series; so do *Check for new chapters*, the library repair and *Fetch newest*. None of that
showed anywhere.

Now every chapter the server downloads is recorded with what started it, and:

- **the pill** comes up for all of it and lists what is downloading right now — the series, the chapter, what
  started it, and whether it is still waiting its turn at the source — plus what came in today;
- **the Offline tab** (the download icon) has an **On the server** section: what is downloading, and what came
  in today, one line per series — *Walk Tale · Ch. 1–7 · Check for new chapters · 2 h ago* — with any chapter
  that could not be saved and why. It is there when nothing is running too, so this morning's chapters from the
  night are one tap away.

Each person sees the series they can open; a brand-new add's first chapter is shown to whoever added it and to
admins. The list is a day deep; new chapters in your favourites also stay on the Updates page until you have seen
them.

### "Read a chapter first" on a phone

In the installed app on a phone, the preview's top bar sat under the status bar, so its ✕ and *Chapters* could
not be pressed and the only way out was *Add to library*. The bar now clears the status bar, both controls are
full-size, and the phone's back gesture steps out the way Escape does: from the chapter to the list, then back to
the add dialog, staying on Discover. The v0.48.0 admin banner had the same status-bar problem, also fixed.

### Upgrading

Nothing to do: no database changes.

## v0.48.0 — 2026-09-26

**Every open issue and pull request, in one release.** Downloads that never reached the library (#109), right to
left that finally works on "Series default" (#102), right-click menus (#100), an admin who is told when the
library needs attention (#101), a device that no longer signs itself out after a flaky refresh (#108), and the
undici update that was held back last time. Three of these started as [@Squeaks72](https://github.com/Squeaks72)'s
proposals and reports; #109 was reported by ZukiFen and Maaster.

### Downloaded chapters that never appeared in the library

On two Unraid installs, chapters downloaded but never showed up ([#109](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/109)):
a *Fetch* said "Fetching 1 chapters" for a second and added nothing, a series added from Discover never
appeared, a manual *Library Scan* changed nothing, and nothing was logged — while the same files moved into the
library folder were picked up at once.

The library scan went through every folder in one pass, and one folder it could not index stopped the whole pass
— silently, on every run, because nothing that started a scan reported its failure. The download folder is
scanned second, so everything this server fetched stayed out of the library. Now a folder the scan cannot index
is stepped over, logged, and named under **Admin → Health → Library scan** with the scanner's reason, and
everything else is indexed. A *Fetch* whose chapter is on disk but still not in the library says so on its card
instead of ending quietly.

One real way to get there is fixed outright: a control character (a NUL) in a source's description was copied
into the chapter's ComicInfo, which Postgres refuses. Those are now stripped both when a chapter is written and
when it is read. And a folder with a deleted twin in another library is now matched to the live series.

If you were affected: update, then run **Admin → Tasks → Library scan**. Your chapters should appear; if
**Admin → Health → Library scan** still names a folder, its reason is what to fix — and we would like to hear it.

### "Series default" can read right to left

Every series used to say it read like a webtoon, so the reader's *Series default* direction could never turn a
page right to left ([#102](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/102), reported by @Squeaks72). A series
now has a reading direction, taken from its chapter files (ComicInfo's `Manga` field), then its source
(MangaDex's original language), then AniList's country of origin — a weaker signal never overrides a stronger
one — and an admin can set it under **Edit details → Reading direction**. Series already in the library are
asked about by a new nightly repair step. The Komga-compatible API reports it too.

The other half of #102 was ours: since v0.46.0, changing a series' theme or layout in the reader also pinned its
direction, so the profile's *Reading direction* never reached that series again. Only a direction you choose for
a series is pinned now, and the accidental pins are ignored. Found on the way: turning pages on a right-to-left
track while the next chapter was loading jumped fourteen pages into it; it moves one.

### Right-click menus

Right-click a series anywhere it appears — the library grid, Home, Up next — or press and hold it on a
touchscreen, or press Shift+F10, for a short menu: **Open in a new tab**, **Copy link**, **Favourite**, **Mark all
read** / **unread**, and for an admin **Check for new chapters** ([#100](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/100),
@Squeaks72's proposal). A chapter row's right-click opens the same menu as its ⋯ button, which now works from
the keyboard and no longer clips at the edge of the screen. The browser's own menu is left alone on selected
text, in text fields and with Shift held, and **Profile → Settings → Appearance → Right-click menus** turns
them off on a device.

### The admin is told when the library needs attention

**Admin → Health** only spoke to someone who went to look. Now, while its last report found something, an
admin's top bar shows a warning mark beside the Updates bell whose tooltip is the worst finding, and a one-line
banner says it once, with **Take a look** and **Not now**
([#101](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/101), @Squeaks72's proposal). *Not now* holds until a
different check finds something. The server runs the checks every six hours for this; the top bar only reads the
stored result, so it costs nothing on every page load. Other accounts see none of it.

### Staying signed in on a flaky connection

When the answer to a session refresh was lost — a page reloaded mid-refresh, a mobile connection dropped the
response — the server had moved on and the browser had not, and the device was signed out a minute later
([#108](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/108)). Reproduced on a 200 ms connection with two reloads in
a row; invisible on a LAN. The server now recognises a lost answer and hands the device its session back —
within a day of the loss; after that it signs in again, as before. Signing out, signing out everywhere and a
password change still end a session at once, and two devices holding one session now end it rather than share
it.

### Also

- **undici 8.11.2.** The 8.11.0 update was held back from v0.47.1 because it left every built-in source empty;
  8.11.2 fixes that upstream, and the test that caught it stays.
- The flaky browser check behind a red CI run and several local failures this week was a signed-out tab, not the
  feature it was checking ([#107](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/107)).

### Upgrading

The database gains columns and nothing is rewritten; the upgrade runs by itself on start. An older version still
starts on an upgraded database.

## v0.47.1 — 2026-09-25

**A double-click in the reader zooms, and only zooms — and every panel that scrolls can be scrolled with a
mouse wheel again.** Both from [@Squeaks72](https://github.com/Squeaks72)
([#99](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/99), [#103](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/103)),
each with a fix on top.

### Double-click to zoom no longer turns the page

A mouse double-click on a page used to zoom *and* turn the page. Repeated to get a closer look, it walked you
several pages into the chapter. The reader acted on a single click after 260 ms, but a second click still
counted as a double for 300 ms, so every double-click with its clicks 260–300 ms apart did both. A slower
double-click (Windows allows up to 900 ms) turned the page twice and never zoomed.

For a mouse the reader now leaves the question to the browser, which knows your operating system's
double-click setting. If the first click has already turned the page by the time the browser says it was a
double-click, the turn is taken back. On a touchscreen one window governs both halves: a tap acts only once a
second tap can no longer arrive. A single click still turns the page, 40 ms later than before.

The fix on top: taking a turn back put the page back but not the progress. A chapter's last page reports the
chapter finished the moment it shows, so a slow double-click whose first click landed there had already marked
the chapter read — Continue moved on, and read-chapter cleanup could remove the file. A page turn from a click
is now not reported as reading until it can no longer be undone. Found in a real browser: at a 650 ms
double-click the pull request as opened sent "completed"; with the fix nothing is sent until the turn is final.

### Panels a mouse wheel could not scroll

On a short window, the reader's settings sheet ended at *Pages per view*: the rows below it (reading direction,
repeated pages, the per-source default) were there, but the wheel would not bring them up
([#103](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/103)). The app's smooth scrolling takes every wheel event
and scrolls the page, unless the element under the pointer is marked as scrolling on its own, and four overlays
never were: the reader settings, confirmation dialogs, the console's group sheet and the downloads panel.

The same gap was in v0.47.0's **Read a chapter first**: on a computer the wheel scrolled the page behind the
preview, so a previewed chapter could not be scrolled at all. Smaller lists inside pages had it too — *Edit
series*, *Add to collection*, the admin's folder picker, row dialogs and import review. All of them scroll now,
and a test reads every page and component in the app, so a new panel that forgets cannot ship.

### Dependencies

- Web: `@tanstack/react-query` 5.103.2, `@types/node` 24.13.6, `tsx` 4.23.15
  ([#97](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/97)).
- Desktop app: TypeScript 7.0.2 for its build checks ([#79](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/79)).
- **Held back:** `undici` 8.11.0 ([#96](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/96)). With it installed,
  Node's built-in `fetch` speaks HTTP/2 to MangaDex and hands back the compressed body without decompressing
  it, so every built-in source would have returned nothing. v0.47.0 added a test that catches this.

### Upgrading

Nothing to do: no database changes.

## v0.47.0 — 2026-09-25

**The four pull requests that could not be merged, rebuilt — and the two issues behind them answered.**
[@Squeaks72](https://github.com/Squeaks72) opened twelve pull requests in one day. Eight went into
[v0.46.0](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/releases/tag/v0.46.0); these four could not go in as they were, because each had a problem that needed the feature
restructured rather than patched — one of them a security hole. Every one is here, built the way it had to be,
and credited in its commit. Nothing below is on by default except the preview button and the compact list's
switch: the three that write or replace anything are off until you ask for them.

### Read a chapter before you add the series

Under **Add to library** there is now **Read a chapter first** ([#91](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/91)):
it opens the title straight from the source, you pick a chapter, scroll it, step to the next, and add it when
you have decided. Nothing is written — no series, no files, no reading progress.

The original passed the chapter id from the browser to the source, and for a site added by URL that means a
request from the bundled Cloudflare solver's browser, which sits on your Docker network beside the database —
the same shape of hole [v0.45.1](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/releases/tag/v0.45.1) closed in the cover proxy. Here a chapter is named by its **number**
in a listing the server fetched itself, and a page by its **index**: no address from the browser ever reaches
a source. The server fetches each page through the same guard your covers go through and serves it without
storing it. Not offered to an account with an age limit — a preview reads a site before any library's rating
applies.

### Which source a new chapter comes from

**Admin → Settings → Source order** ([#93](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/93), first half) ranks
your sources, and a series can have its own order on its *Sources & translations* sheet. When two followed
sources both have a chapter and your scanlation-group preferences do not decide between them, the higher-ranked
source wins — the choice that used to go to whichever source the series was added from. It only decides where
chapters you do not have yet come from; nothing already downloaded is replaced because of it.

An order keeps every source you put in it, including one that is not loaded at the moment: the original built
its list from the sources registered right now, and the extension engine restarting is enough to make that
list empty, so one press of an arrow saved an order with every extension silently gone from it.

### Your preferred group's version, once it exists

This is what issue [#81](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/81) was really asking for. A new chapter
waits for a group you rank only as long as its patience; after that it is taken from whoever has it, and the
preferred group's copy turning up a day later was never looked at again. **Admin → Settings → Scanlators →
Upgrade chapters to a preferred group** (off by default) gives the nightly repair a step that takes that second
look, and swaps the chapter for the better group's copy.

It replaces files on disk, so it is careful, and the rules are the reason the original half of #93 was not
merged: only files Uchiyomi downloaded itself, **never** a copy with fewer pages than the one you have (a
one-page "chapter removed" notice from the right group does not win), never one that arrives incomplete, never
a chapter somebody picked a version for by hand, at most ten a night, and a failed swap waits a week. Reading
progress and bookmarks are kept — the file is written over the same row.

### Chapter names from a source that has them

Some sources publish no chapter titles at all; every row reads *Ch. 12*, while another source has had *Romance
Dawn* all along. **Borrow chapter names from other sources** ([#85](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/85),
off by default, per server and per series) lets the nightly repair take the names from that other source.

The hazard is numbering, not names: past the point where two sources number a work differently every borrowed
name would be wrong, and a plausible wrong title is exactly what you pick the next chapter by. So a donor has
to pass the same check a source must pass before Uchiyomi will *follow* it, names are matched by exact number,
and only a source in the same language is asked. The original searched through the machinery that reports
slow sources to the health page, so a lookup only for names could put your main source into a cooldown and
stop real downloads; nothing here reports. A borrowed name never touches the file, the chapter's own source
naming it later always wins, and switching it off takes back exactly what was borrowed.

### What the server is downloading, and stopping it

Issue [#82](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/82) asked where to see what is downloading. The pill in
the corner only knew the jobs you started from a button; everything the server did by itself was invisible and
could not be stopped. Now every running download has a **Cancel** — it stops after the chapter in flight, so a
file is never left half-written, and what already arrived stays — and an admin also sees the server's own runs:
*Checking for new chapters*, *Library repair* and a bulk *Fetch newest*, each with how far it has got, which
series it is on, and a Cancel of its own. Downloads that finished in the last day are listed under the rest;
Discover's strip still shows only the last few minutes.

### A leaner chapter list, if you want one

**Profile → Settings → Compact chapter list** ([#88](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/88)) drops the
thumbnail and the status dot and shows the row's buttons on hover, on a computer. It is a per-device choice:
the original made it everyone's default, and the thumbnail is each chapter's own first page — it carries the
read dimming, the progress bar and a deleted chapter's dashed box.

### Upgrading

The database gains columns and nothing is rewritten; the upgrade runs by itself on start. An older version
still starts on an upgraded database, so rolling back stays possible.

## v0.46.0 — 2026-09-25

**Eight pull requests from [@Squeaks72](https://github.com/Squeaks72) -- seven merged with fixes on top, one as it
was -- and a memory cap on the extension engine.** Most of this release is theirs: right-to-left paging, one key
per page, settings pinned to a source, type-to-search, chapter names, a chapter list that pages past chapter 1000,
a Discover search that keeps its source, and an 18+ filter an admin can widen. Every one of them was reviewed line by line, and the fixes are separate
commits on their branches, so the history says who did what.

### The extension engine can no longer eat the machine

The extension engine is [Suwayomi-Server](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server), run headless: it is what
runs Mihon and Tachiyomi extensions, and you never open it. Discussion
[#72](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/discussions/72) came from someone who had left Suwayomi and found it
running underneath, "eating my ram and cpu". It ran with no memory limit at all, and a JVM without one sizes its
heap from the host: a quarter of its memory, 15.7 GiB on a 62 GB server. Every compose file now gives it the
desktop app's own numbers for the same engine, a 768 MB heap and the serial collector under a 1.5 GB ceiling.
`SUWAYOMI_MEM_LIMIT` and `SUWAYOMI_JAVA_OPTS` raise both for a very long extension list.

⚠️ **Updating the image does not update your compose file.** An install set up before v0.46.0 gets the cap by
downloading [`deploy/docker-compose.yml`](deploy/docker-compose.yml) again, or by adding two lines under
`uchiyomi-suwayomi`:

```yaml
    mem_limit: 1536m
    environment:
      JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: "-Xmx768m -XX:+UseSerialGC"
```

The README and the install files now say what the engine is, that it ships on, and that MangaDex and sites added
by URL work without it. The split layout's Cloudflare solver also gets the `/dev/shm` headroom, memory cap and
healthcheck the other layouts already had.

### Reading

- **Paged mode can read right to left** ([#90](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/90)): *Reading
  direction* in the reader's settings, for one series or pinned to a source, and as your default under
  Profile → Settings. *Series default* follows a series that says it reads right to left, which today means a
  Komga library that records it; Uchiyomi's own library does not record a direction yet, so nothing turns
  around by itself on update. Under the Arabic interface the paged track used to inherit right-to-left, and
  the page counter stuck on page 1; it no longer does. Fixed on top: resume and `?page=` links
  on a right-to-left series opened page 1, the bottom bar ran opposite to its pages under Arabic, text inside the
  track took the track's direction, and a double-tap zoom in paged mode jumped to mid-chapter.
- **One key is one page** in paged mode ([#92](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/92)). Fixed on top:
  quick presses could land two pages on, Alt+← turned a page instead of going Back, Ctrl+F opened Find *and*
  toggled fullscreen (already on main), keys acted under an open sheet, Escape left the reader instead of closing
  the sheet, and Space on a focused button turned the page.
- **Reader settings can be pinned to a source** ([#95](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/95)): a webtoon
  site continuous, a manga site paged right to left. Fixed on top: the reader's look used to be saved as the
  global default whenever you changed it with a title open, the pin never applied to downloaded chapters, and a
  raw 19-digit extension id could appear instead of a name. ⚠️ **Behaviour change:** changing mode, theme, spread
  or direction inside the reader now applies to that series only; the global default lives under
  Profile → Settings.
- In paged mode with *Collapse*, a repeated page showed as a blank slide with a faint number. It is shown like any
  other page there now. The reader settings sheet was in English in every language; it is translated.

### The library

- **Chapter names** ([#84](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/84)): "Ch. 12 · The Return" on the series
  page, and Continue says which chapter it opens. Names come from the source, in their own column: "Vol.3
  Chapter 12: The Return" is named "The Return", and "Chapter 12" or "第12話" is the number again, so no name.
  A library built by hand never shows a filename as a name. Chapters already downloaded are named the next time
  their series is checked.
- **Chapters past 1000** ([#89](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/89)): Continue opened chapter 1 for
  anyone reading past chapter 1000, and the reader's chapter list stopped there. Long lists page 100 at a time,
  named by the chapter numbers each page shows, and opening on the page that holds Continue.
- **Discover keeps your chosen source through a search** ([#87](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/87)).
- **Type anywhere to search** ([#94](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/94)): start typing a title on any
  page. Under Japanese or Chinese it opens empty so the input method composes properly, and Profile → Settings →
  *Type anywhere to search* switches it and "/" off on that device.

### 18+

**An admin can mark genres and sources as 18+** ([#86](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/86)), Admin →
Settings → 18+ filter, with a per-series *Always show*. They widen what "Show 18+" hides everywhere, including
OPDS, the Komga-compatible API, notification digests and the automatic source hunt. They never widen what anyone
may open: the age cap is still the only permission. Fixed on top: the genre list is read in SQL rather than
pasted into it, "Find missing chapters" and Fetch no longer answer 404 for a series the switch hides (already true
of 18+ libraries on main), and source ids keep their `_`.

### Housekeeping

- Desktop builds on a pull request are signed the way pushes to main are, so macOS CI stopped failing on every
  pull request. Desktop type-checks under TypeScript 7.
- Node majors and `@types/node` majors are taken deliberately, onto the next LTS, not from weekly Dependabot pull
  requests; `bff` is back on Node 24's types.

## v0.45.1 — 2026-09-25

**A security fix. If anyone other than you has an account on your server, update.**

### The cover proxy no longer lets an account steer the Cloudflare solver

Covers from sites behind Cloudflare are fetched with the help of the bundled solver, FlareSolverr: a real
browser, running on the same Docker network as the extension engine and the database. The cover proxy takes the
image's address from the request, and for a Cloudflare-protected source it handed that address to the solver
*before* checking that it was a public address. The check that did run first knew private IP addresses, but not
bare container names like the ones in the install file. So any signed-in account could make the solver open
addresses inside your network. Nothing it found came back to them, but the requests were made, and a browser
does more than fetch: it follows redirects and runs the scripts of the page it opens.

It needs a signed-in account. Nobody without one could reach it.

Three changes, each with a test that fails without it:

- **The public-address check runs before anything touches the network**, the solver included.
- **A host name with no dot is refused outright.** No public host is a single word; container names are.
- **For an address that came from a request, the solver only opens hosts the source vouched for**: the site an
  admin added, or a host that source has actually served covers from. Library covers come from your own database
  and are fetched as before, which matters: some sites keep their covers on a separate Cloudflare-protected CDN
  that answers 403 without the solver.

Readers see no difference. Covers load as they did.

Found while reviewing [#91](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/91), a chapter preview from
[@Squeaks72](https://github.com/Squeaks72) that had the same shape of problem in a new route; it is being rebuilt
around this fix.

## v0.45.0 — 2026-09-24

**The desktop app can also be a window onto your own server; adding an extension repository is spelled out,
in the app and in the docs; and the desktop app has a real guide.** The owner asked for three things the day
v0.44.0 shipped: that the Windows and Mac app should also work with "our usual self-hosted version by putting in
the website url", asked on first launch; better documentation of the desktop app; and a clearer way to learn how
to add the extensions repository. This release is those three.

### Uchiyomi Desktop: "On this computer" or "Connect to my server"

The first launch now asks **"How do you want to use Uchiyomi?"**:

* **On this computer** is v0.44.0's app, unchanged: the library folder question (now with a **Back** button),
  then the whole app on the PC — its own server, database, downloads and extension engine.
* **Connect to my server** asks for the address you open Uchiyomi at in a browser — `https://manga.example.com`,
  `http://192.168.1.10:8080` — checks that an Uchiyomi server answers there, says *Connected to* and its name,
  and opens it in the window. **Nothing runs on the computer in this mode**: no database, no server, no engine,
  no sign-in secret. You sign in on your server's own page, and every tab is your server's.

An install that already chose a library folder in v0.44.0 is never asked: it opens standalone, as before. You
can switch at any time from the tray or menu-bar icon — **Connect to my server instead…** in one mode; **Switch
server…**, **Use on this computer instead** and **Forget this server…** in the other — and switching never
touches the library on the computer.

* **Checked before it is saved.** The address is reduced to its origin (a path is dropped and said so, since
  Uchiyomi must be at the root of its address; with no scheme typed, `https://` is tried and the message says to
  type `http://` in full if that is what the server uses), redirects are followed hop by hop and the final
  origin stored (one that leads to another host name is shown and waits for **Continue**), and `/auth/config`
  must answer like an Uchiyomi server. Each refusal names its cause: unreachable, not an
  Uchiyomi server, an HTTP error, a user name in the address, another copy of the desktop app, or a proxy's
  password prompt (HTTP Basic Auth is not supported yet, and says so). A sign-in portal in front of the server
  (Authelia-style forward auth — one that sends you on to its sign-in page, or one that answers 401/403 itself)
  is recognised and offered as **Continue**; the window follows it, and single sign-on round trips stay in the
  window.
* **Self-signed certificates: asked once, remembered, loud when they change** (the owner's decision). A
  certificate the computer does not trust shows *Trust this server's certificate?* with the server, its SHA-256
  fingerprint (the value `openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256` prints), the issuer and the expiry; **Trust
  this server** remembers exactly that certificate for that host name. A pinned host presenting any other
  certificate gets a red *This server's certificate has changed*, with both fingerprints and no one-click way
  past it — **Trust the new certificate…** only arms a second button, and a double-click does not confirm it.
  There is no accept-all path: Chromium's own refusal stays the answer to anything that is neither trusted by
  the system nor the pinned certificate. A server saved while the computer trusted its certificate is
  remembered as such, so a self-signed certificate there later gets the same red warning with no way to trust
  it (**Forget this server…** starts again). Only the server's own certificate is ever asked about, never one
  that a page's other requests or another host present.
* **The window onto a server gets no desktop bridge at all.** The page is the server's, so it is given only an
  inert `window.uchiyomiShell = { mode: 'server', version }` and never `window.uchiyomiDesktop` — even for a
  server on the same PC at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, which the old address-only check would have treated as the
  app's own and left unable to sign in. A v0.45.0 server reads the marker to hide its *Install Uchiyomi* row;
  older servers ignore it.
* **Server mode behaves like a window, not a service.** Closing it quits (nothing local to keep running, so no
  tray keep-alive; on Windows that also installs a downloaded update, as Quit does). A server that does not
  answer shows *Can't reach {name}* with **Try again**, **Change server…** and **Use on this computer
  instead**; over https the server's own service worker still serves what was saved offline. The window title
  and the tray tooltip are the server's name. **Forget this server…** signs out and removes what the app kept
  for it (offline chapters, settings, the trusted certificate), then asks the first question again — where **On
  this computer** reopens the library already on the computer, in its folder. **Use on this computer instead**
  with no library there yet shows the folder page first, with **Back** to the server, and switches only once a
  folder is chosen. The server's *New-chapter alerts* switch is not offered inside the window (Electron has no
  push service); a line points to the server's notification targets instead.
* `--server-url=<address>` is the non-interactive "Connect to my server" for scripts and CI, as `--library-dir`
  is for the other mode; a mode already saved wins over both. The mode, server and pins live in `state.json`
  (`mode`, `serverOrigin`, `serverName`, `certPins`).
* Every new sentence in the shell — 57 of them — is in all nine languages.

Four things only the real Electron app showed, all fixed here: a page's own `window.close()` destroys the window
without Electron's `close` event (server mode was left running with no window); Chromium caches a refused
certificate per session even after the verify procedure changes, so a certificate the person had just trusted
kept failing (the check now probes in a fresh session and relaunches after a trust); the server's service worker
answered navigations from its cache, so a changed certificate showed no warning at all (the prompt now comes
from the refusal itself, not from a failed page load); and the chooser's cards did not wrap.

### Adding an extension repository, made obvious

**In the app** (**Admin → Extensions**):

* With no repository yet, the repository row is **open by itself** — the address field was hidden behind a
  collapsed *Manage* while the empty list below said "add a repository above".
* The field asks for `https://…/index.min.json` (the shape Mihon users have), and the help text says what a
  repository is, that it is *the same address you added in Mihon (More → Settings → Browse → Extension repos)*,
  and that a repository's *Add to Mihon* link works too. While it checks, a line says *this can take up to a
  minute*.
* **What you paste is understood.** An *Add to Mihon* link (`mihon://add-repo?url=…`, `tachiyomi://…`, or a web
  `…/add-repo?url=…`) is unwrapped, a missing `https://` is added, a GitHub `…/blob/<branch>/index.min.json`
  link becomes the raw file, and a GitHub repository *page* is refused with advice rather than saved. An
  `index.json` or a bare folder that gives nothing is tried once as the `index.min.json` there, the only file the
  extension engine reads a list from (the old retry went the other way, `index.min.json` → `index.json`, which
  the engine never accepts).
* **Success is what this repository brought.** *Added — {n} extensions from this repository*, never the size of
  the whole catalogue: before, adding a broken second repository reported *Added — 1396 extensions available*.
  A repository that yields nothing is **removed again** and answered *That address gave no extensions, so it was
  not kept…*, with the engine's reason when it gives one. A duplicate is
  recognised whatever its case, scheme, trailing slash or index file name. An engine that refuses the address,
  or cannot be read, answers with its reason and leaves the list exactly as it was (a failed read used to be
  taken as "no repositories", so the next add would have dropped every other one).
* Refusals stay in red under the field until the address is edited, because a toast is gone in three seconds.
  After a success, a next-step line says to choose extensions and to hide unused languages first — only 25
  sources can be on at once — with a **Choose languages** button. Every string in the flow is translated.
* **A removed repository stays removed.** The scheduled extension check restores the repository list from its own
  copy, and that copy was only ever written the first time the check ran: a repository removed in the app came
  back at the next check, and one added in the app was never protected. Adding and removing now keep it in step.
  The check also compares repositories the way a duplicate is recognised, not letter for letter: the engine
  lists a pasted `index.min.json` as its `repo.json` once it restarts, and a check that had saved the pasted form
  wrote the repository back a second time and sent *Extension repositories restored*, after every restart.
* The Docker *engine off* card names the container the shipped compose files actually use, `uchiyomi-suwayomi`
  (it said the development stack's `yomi-suwayomi`). On the desktop app, before the engine is downloaded, the
  Providers tab's Extensions card says *Not installed yet — download it under Extensions* instead of *The
  extension engine isn't running*, which read as a fault on a first visit.

**API** (`POST /api/admin/extensions/repos`): 200 `{ ok, url, corrected, added, total }` with `added` counted for
this repository; refusals carry a stable `error` — 400 `bad_url` / `github_page`, 409 `exists`, 422 `empty`
(removed again), 502 `unreachable` / `engine_refused` with `reason`. `DELETE` answers `{ ok, removed }`. Both are in
`openapi.yaml` and [api.md](docs/api.md).

### Documentation

* **[docs/DESKTOP.md](docs/DESKTOP.md)**, the desktop guide, written for someone who has never run a server:
  which file (and how to tell an Apple silicon Mac from an Intel one), which release files to ignore, the browser
  download warning, the Windows SmartScreen and Smart App Control situation and the macOS 15 *Open Anyway*
  sequence (and macOS 14's Control-click → Open) — each OS step cited to Microsoft's or Apple's own pages — the
  two modes and when to pick which, the first sources (MangaDex, a site, the extension engine and a repository),
  server mode's address rules, certificates and error page, updates per OS (including the Mac's quit, drag,
  replace), backups, where files live, uninstalling, and troubleshooting with the user-level steps first. The
  desktop chapter of the user guide (§14) is now a pointer to it, and the README keeps one short section.
* **[docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md)** starts with *Add an extension repository — step by step*: what a
  repository is, what its address looks like and where to find yours, the *Add to Mihon* link, what each message
  means, removing one, and languages and the 25-source limit; then where the engine comes from on each kind of
  install (Docker, the desktop download, CasaOS, Unraid and Umbrel without one, server mode using the server's).
* One memory figure for the engine everywhere: about 750 MB once running (731 MiB measured on a server with 22
  extensions installed). The docs had said half a gigabyte, 800 MB and 1 GB.
* The user guide's table of contents links for §7 and §10 work again, and §1, §2 and the FAQ point desktop
  readers to the right place.
* **No third-party names.** The docs no longer name a third-party extension repository or real scanlation
  groups, and every screenshot of the extension flow and the sources list is taken on made-up data — *Example
  Manga (EN)*, generated icons, `https://example.org/repo/index.min.json` — by a fixture in the screenshot rig
  that applies to every run. The old extension shots showed real site names, some of them 18+; the icon strips
  on uchiyomi.com were real sites' logos. The desktop app's own pages are photographed from the real Electron
  app.

### Permanent download links

Every release now also carries the installers under names without a version — `Uchiyomi-Setup.exe`,
`Uchiyomi-mac-arm64.dmg`, `Uchiyomi-mac-x64.dmg` — so
`https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/releases/latest/download/Uchiyomi-Setup.exe` always serves the newest
one. The README, the desktop guide and uchiyomi.com link to those. The update feeds keep naming the versioned
files, which are unchanged. A test holds every such link in the docs to a name the release actually uploads.

### For server installs

The server changes are the repository route above (and the scheduled extension check's copy of the list, which
it now keeps in step) and two web-app details: the Extensions tab's repository flow, and the *Install Uchiyomi*
row hidden inside the desktop app's window. Nothing else in the server or the web app changed.

## v0.44.0 — 2026-09-24

**Uchiyomi Desktop (beta).** The owner asked, a day before this release, whether Uchiyomi could be something you
*download as an app* — "empty of manga, you add the extensions repo and the manga sites in admin, everything
exactly same as now, the only difference it won't be on your server and all the manga will be on your own pc".
It can: this release is that app, for Windows and both kinds of Mac, attached to this GitHub Release beside the
unchanged Docker images.

**Nothing changes for a server.** Every server-side difference sits behind one switch, `UCHIYOMI_DESKTOP`, read
in one file; with it off — every Docker install — the server has the same routes, the same responses, the same
listen address and the same defaults as v0.43.0, and the tests that say so are listed under *For server
installs* below, together with the few places where code a server also runs was touched, and why that is
identical on Linux.

### Uchiyomi Desktop (beta): the whole app on your own Windows PC or Mac

It is the same app, screen for screen — the same server and the same web app, inside an Electron shell — with
the library in a folder on your computer. No Docker, no server to keep running, no account to create: it opens
signed in, on an empty library, and sources, sites and extensions are added in Admin exactly as on a server.

| Your computer | Download |
|---|---|
| Windows (x64) | `Uchiyomi-Setup-0.44.0.exe` — installs for your account only, no administrator prompt |

**Unsigned, for now** (the owner's call; signing is a drop-in later). Windows SmartScreen asks once — **More
info → Run anyway** — and a PC with **Smart App Control** on blocks it outright, so the Docker install is the
answer there. macOS refuses the first launch until **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**.
Windows then updates itself in the background and installs on quit; a Mac cannot update an unsigned app, so it
says *New version X — download* in the menu-bar menu and on the Version card in Admin → Health instead.

What is in it:

* **First run** asks one question, *"Where should Uchiyomi keep your manga?"*, defaulting to `Uchiyomi
  Library` in your home folder — not inside Documents, which OneDrive and iCloud like to sync. A synced folder
  gets a warning, and the app's own data folder, a drive root or the home folder itself are refused.
* **No sign-in, ever.** The first start creates one local admin named after your computer account. The shell
  signs its window in through a private handshake: a fresh 256-bit secret per launch, added by the shell below
  the page to one loopback-only request, compared as a digest, and removed from the server's environment so no
  child process inherits it. A browser pointed at the same port gets *"This library opens in the Uchiyomi app
  on this computer."*
* **Its own PostgreSQL 16**, the same major version as the Docker image, with `pg_dump` and `psql`, on
  loopback with a password that never appears on a command line (macOS shows every user's).
* **Its own Cloudflare helper** instead of FlareSolverr: a FlareSolverr-compatible endpoint the shell serves from
  hidden browser windows, so neither the server nor the extension engine changed to use it. It reuses a site's
  clearance cookie instead of solving again, and when a site insists on a human, a window *"Uchiyomi needs you
  to verify <site>"* opens if you are at the computer.
* **The extension engine on first use.** Admin → Extensions offers *Download the extension engine (about 200
  MB)*: a slim pack of Suwayomi-Server and its own Java runtime, published on its own `engine-v2.3.2243`
  prerelease and checked against a SHA-256 pinned in the app. Once downloaded it installs and starts in
  seconds, and starts with the app from then on; the repository list ships empty, as on a server. ⚠️ **Extensions that need an
  in-app web view do not work** in the desktop app: the engine's own Chromium download (KCEF) is off, because on
  macOS the engine died on every start with it on.
* **The tray / menu bar.** Closing the window keeps Uchiyomi running, so checks and downloads carry on: *Open*,
  *Check for new chapters*, *Restore a backup…*, the update item, *Start when I log in* (off by default) and
  *Quit*, which stops everything in order — the server finishes the chapter it is writing first.
* **Backups** every night as on a server (`db.sql.gz` + `config.zip`), plus what a computer needs: a backup
  runs about five minutes after start when the last one is more than a day old, and re-aims within a minute
  after the machine wakes from sleep. **Restore a backup…** (Admin → Tasks, or the tray) saves a safety copy
  first, replaces the database in one transaction, and restarts; the manga files are never touched.
* **Left out, because they exist for other people or other devices:** the sign-in screen, passwords, 2FA,
  sessions and sign-out, single sign-on and registration; members and per-library access; OPDS, the
  Komga-compatible API (and its Mihon setting) and API tokens; web push (the window has no push service —
  notification targets still work); *Save offline* and the Offline tab (the chapters are already on this disk);
  and the install count, which the desktop app never sends. The server answers *not found* for every one of
  them, and listens on `127.0.0.1` only, so nothing on your network can reach it.
* **Sooner schedules**, because a computer is switched off far more than a server: the first new-chapter and
  extension checks after 2 minutes, the Cloudflare helper check after 1, repair and the clean-ups after 5, the
  daily source check a day after its last run. Downloads keep **5 GB** free (10 on a server) and the image
  cache is capped at **4 GiB** (16).
* **Windows-safe files:** folder names lose trailing dots and spaces and control characters, reserved names get
  a `_` (`CON` → `CON_`), stored paths always use `/`, a rename that antivirus briefly blocks is retried, and on
  case-insensitive disks (NTFS, APFS) a series whose folder exists in another case reuses it, and a case-only
  rename works.
* **Messages that talked about Docker** — containers, `PUID`, `chown`, `shm_size`, `SUWAYOMI_MAX_SOURCES` —
  say what to do on a computer instead, in the server's Health and diagnosis text and in 25 new sentences in
  the app, each translated into the other eight languages. The shell's own tray, first-run and dialog
  sentences follow the system language, in the same nine.

Where the files live, the hidden settings for troubleshooting, and uninstalling are in the new chapter
[14. Uchiyomi Desktop](docs/USAGE.md#14-uchiyomi-desktop) of the guide; the downloads and first-launch steps
are in the [README](README.md#download-the-desktop-app).

**How it was proven.** A spike ran first, on GitHub's Windows and macOS runners: the server unchanged inside
Electron (its full test suite identical under Electron's Node), the bundled PostgreSQL (including a Windows user
name that is not ASCII), an update installed over a running app, the web app's service worker and storage inside
the window, the extension engine pack on all three platforms, and the Cloudflare helper side by side with
FlareSolverr on real sites.
Every release now builds the three installers on those runners and, on each, runs a product smoke on a fresh
profile — first run, signed in with no password form, a real MangaDex chapter downloaded into the chosen folder
and read in the window, the extension engine installed through the app, Quit leaving no process behind, and a
relaunch signed in — plus the Windows update and the macOS unsigned-update checks. It has not yet been tried on
many real PCs, which is why it is a beta.

**What was verified before tagging.** On Windows x64, macOS arm64 and macOS x64 (GitHub runners, the installers
built from this commit): 31 product checks, none failing — the product smoke above with the *published* extension
engine pack, the sign-in handshake's refusals (no secret, a wrong one, a foreign origin, a password login), the
app's own backup, Postgres recovering from a power cut and from an orphaned server, a standard (non-administrator)
Windows user, a Windows profile named `Jösé 名前` (database and extension engine both on the private ASCII
fallback), the Windows installer run over a running app and a vN → vN+1 update keeping the data, and on both Macs
a rebuilt unsigned app opening straight into the library, signed in, with nothing in the Keychain. The shell's
own suite (88 tests, the solver's contract against the bff's real client and Suwayomi's DTOs, the solver in real
hidden Electron windows). And the server, with the switch off: the whole bff suite on a fresh database (172 files,
1837 tests, none failing), the web app's 421 tests, the production build, the browser end-to-end suite and walks
v0.40–v0.43 each on its own instance, the layout at 1440 and 390 px and all nine languages.

Real machines caught three things the Linux tests could not, all fixed here: an unsigned Mac kept the cookie key
in the Keychain under the build's own signature, so an update hung behind a hidden password prompt and even a
restart lost the session (cookie encryption stays off until the builds are signed); the window refused its own
extension-engine progress while the server restarted after the install; and the review found that another account
on the same PC could bind the app's port in the seconds before the server did and receive the sign-in secret — the
shell now trusts the port only after its own server process reports holding it, and loads nothing from it before.

### For server installs: nothing changes

The switch is read in `bff/src/lib/desktop.ts` alone, and every place that behaves differently asks it, with
the server's own value as the other answer. With the switch off, `desktopOff.test.ts` checks that importing it
changes nothing in the environment and that every server arm hands back the server value;
`desktopSwitchHygiene.test.ts` checks that the flag is read nowhere else, that the server keeps its literals
(`0.0.0.0`, `trustProxy`, the first-run delays, the backup and custom-sites paths), and that new routes exist
only behind the switch; `openapiCoverage.test.ts` still pins the route table (`POST /auth/desktop` is not in it:
it is registered only on desktop and is deliberately not a documented API). **No change unless running as the
desktop app** in:

* `env.ts`, `server.ts`, `routes/auth.ts`, `lib/auth.ts` — the switch, the local sign-in, the listen address,
  the route guard, and the schedulers' first-run delays;
* `backup.ts`, `fsGuard.ts`, `health.ts`, `sourceDiagnosis.ts` — the desktop wording and the desktop backup
  (bundled `pg_dump`, `config.zip`); every server string is byte-for-byte what it was;
* `libraryAdmin.ts`, `routes/sources.ts`, `routes/admin.ts`, `sources/customSites.ts` — the case-insensitive
  and Windows-path branches;
* the web app: every hidden surface is gated on the desktop shell or on the server saying `desktop: true`,
  which a server never says, so a Docker install renders exactly as before.

**Code a server also runs, changed for Windows and identical on Linux** — said plainly, because these are not
behind the switch:

* `chapterFileRel` builds the stored chapter path with `path.posix.join`. On Linux that is `path.join`; on
  Windows `path.join` wrote `\`, so the nightly repair, the Health *Fix* chip and *Fetch again* never matched a
  downloaded chapter there.
* A restored refetch file is recorded with `/`; partial-chapter completion takes the folder with the POSIX
  `dirname`; the web root normalises `\` before choosing its cache headers — all the same bytes on Linux.
* The library scanner's symlink-loop guard keys folders by device and inode on Linux, as before, and by real path
  on Windows only; the rename retry for antivirus and the extra `sanitize` rules run on Windows only.
* Paths typed in Admin → Library go through a `\`-to-`/` conversion that does nothing on Linux (a `\` is a legal
  character in a Linux file name, so it is left alone there).
* The backup scheduler now also reads `backup_last_run`, and ignores it unless it is the desktop app.
* Two web changes with no visible effect: the sign-in screen waits for `/auth/config` when the first-run check
  answers *not found*, which a server never does; and the five "am I offline" checks go through one helper that
  reads `navigator.onLine` the same way.

### Release pipeline

* `release.yml` gains a `desktop` job — `.github/workflows/desktop.yml` on the three runners — with no `needs`,
  so the images never wait for it, and `desktop-publish`, which needs both the Release and every desktop leg,
  checks each installer against its update feed (size and SHA-512), merges the two macOS feeds, uploads the
  installers first and `latest.yml` / `latest-mac.yml` last, and adds a download section to the Release notes.
  A red desktop build leaves the Release as the images alone until its jobs are re-run.
* New `engine-pack.yml` builds the engine pack on each OS, boots it there, and publishes all three on the
  `engine-v*` **prerelease** (never "latest", so no updater mistakes it for the app); a pack the app already
  pins is never replaced. `desktop/scripts/release/pin-engine.mjs` pins the hashes from what was actually
  published.
* Dependabot watches `/desktop`; `.dockerignore` keeps `desktop/` out of every image build; the Phase 0 spike
  workflows are gone.
* Versions: `bff`, `web`, `openapi.yaml` and `desktop/package.json` are 0.44.0; `desktopParity.test.ts` now
  holds the desktop version to the server's.

### Known limits of the beta

* Unsigned: SmartScreen once, Smart App Control blocks it, and macOS updates are a download.
* No Linux or Windows on Arm build; Docker covers both.
* The library folder is chosen once; moving it later is not in this version. Neither is moving a library from a
  Docker server into the app: *Restore a backup…* refuses a server's backup, whose series point at the server's
  folders.
* Extensions that need an in-app web view do not work (KCEF is off).
* After the computer sleeps, the scheduled jobs other than the backup can run one interval late.
* On a Mac, *Start when I log in* may open the window at login instead of starting in the menu bar.
* Very deep library folders can pass Windows Explorer's 260-character path limit; Uchiyomi itself copes, but
  Explorer may not open them.
* Found on the way and left for changes of their own: on a server, *Delete files*' check that a folder is
  inside the library cuts the folder's real path at the library path's length, which misreads a library reached
  through a symlink (fixed on desktop only, to keep the server byte-identical in this release); and on desktop
  the audit log's own IP helper still reads a forwarded-for header (sessions use the fixed one, so only another
  program on the same computer could put a false address in the audit log).

### Notes

New tests: `desktopOff`, `desktopSwitchHygiene`, `desktopAuth` (and its database twin), `desktopRoutes`,
`relPath`, `backupSchedule`, `desktopCopy`, `desktopPaths`, `desktopBackup`, `libBooksRoot` and `desktopParity`
on the server; `desktopSession` and `desktopSurfaces` in the web app; the shell's own suite in `desktop/test`
(unit, contract and the solver in real Electron windows); and `releasePipeline` now pins the desktop jobs, the
engine prerelease, the feed checks and the upload order. Every guard added carries, as a comment, the exact edit
that puts its bug back, and was run that way. There is no new server environment variable for a Docker install
and no migration.

## v0.43.0 — 2026-09-23

Three issues, all from people using this: a performance mode for a modest PC, asked for by **@nealhead**
(#71), and two from **@TIGamingTV** — progress on chapters the server never downloaded (#69), and
notifications that reach something other than a browser (#70), which he filed while saying he would not
build it himself because the security was too complicated. It was, a little; the rules are below.

The defaults stay where they were: Reduce effects is off, a mark exists only once a reader makes one, and no
notification goes anywhere until an admin adds a target. The one change to the default look is a fix: the
unprefixed `backdrop-filter` now survives the build, so every browser that supports it blurs the glass panels
as Safari always did.

### Reduce effects: the performance mode (#71, @nealhead)

**Profile → Settings → Appearance → Reduce effects**, off by default. The report was "laggy, stutters when
scrolling or moving between areas", on Firefox 156 and Windows 11, with a request for a performance mode —
and this is that mode. It turns off, at once and without a reload:

* the animated background, the film grain and the vignette (not dimmed: not rendered at all);
* every backdrop blur, with the glass panels turning solid;
* smooth (Lenis) scrolling, leaving the browser's native scrolling;
* the cover blur-in and the loading shimmer;
* card tilt;
* the page and settings-panel transitions;
* the accent rim on cards (each keeps its own plain border underneath).

It is one switch per **account**, stored with your other settings, so it follows you to another device; a
copy on the device covers an offline launch and is cleared at sign-out, so the next person on a shared tablet
gets their own setting. The system's *reduce motion* setting is separate and unchanged, and does not turn this
on: someone who asked their OS for less motion did not ask for the grain or the glass to go.

**The look is unchanged by design.** That was the owner's call: the app does not get plainer for everyone
because one machine is slow, so the default keeps every effect exactly as v0.42.0 drew it, and Reduce effects
is the performance mode. Frozen screenshots of home, the library and a series page at 1440 and 390 px render
pixel-identical to v0.42.0, apart from the glass fix below. The rule left room for optimisations nobody can
see, if they bought frames; four were measured — `contain: strict` on the three layers, `translateZ(0)`,
`isolation: isolate` on the page, `will-change` on the background — and none bought one (`will-change` on the
animated background made the library five times *slower*), so none shipped.

What it measured, on the same instance and data with the v0.42.0 web build swapped for this one, median of
three runs (two for the v0.42.0 Firefox rows). The library in these rows is 200 series, every fourth a
favourite.

**Scrolling — headless Chrome 152, CPU throttled 4×/6×, 1440×900 / 390×844** (fps, then the share of frames
over 33 ms)

| | v0.42.0 | v0.43.0 default | v0.43.0 Reduce effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| library 1440, 4× | 38.8 (49 %) | 40.7 (44 %) | **60 (0 %)** |
| home 1440, 4× | 51.2 (16 %) | 53.3 (11 %) | **60 (0 %)** |
| library 1440, 6× | 40.5 (45 %) | 41.3 (43 %) | **60 (0 %)** |
| library 390, 4× | 60 | 60 | 60 |
| home 390, 4× | 59.6 | 60 | 60 |

**Scrolling — headless Firefox 155, unthrottled** (it composites in software, which puts on the CPU what a
weak GPU pays for, so it is the closer stand-in for the reporter's machine)

| | v0.42.0 | v0.43.0 default | v0.43.0 Reduce effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| library 1440 | 7.7 | 7.6 | **57.9** |
| home 1440 | 12.3 | 8.9 | **55.1** |
| library 390 | n/a (the rig crashed; fixed since) | 19.3 | **60** |

The two default columns are the same CSS; home's 12.3 against 8.9 is Firefox's run-to-run spread.

**Everything else — headless Chrome 152**

| | v0.42.0 | v0.43.0 default | v0.43.0 Reduce effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| composited layers, library 1440 | 184 (66.1 Mpx) | 184 | **24 (22.1 Mpx)** |
| composited layers, home 1440 | 62 (20.5 Mpx) | 62 | **6 (5 Mpx)** |
| page transition home → library, 4× | 39.6 fps | 42.8–50.3 | **58.1–58.7** |
| page transition home → library, 6× | 49.8 fps | 40.6–43.9 | **58.7–59.4** |
| card tilt sweep, home rail, 4× | not measured | 56.5 (53 tilts) | 60 (0 tilts) |
| phone nav pill, 390, 4× | 60 | 60 | 60 |

Those default columns were measured before the glass fix below, so the scrolling rows were measured again on
the release build with the same rig: in Chrome, default 40.6 / 54.4 / 41.5 / 59.2 / 60 fps down the first
table's rows and 60 on every row with the switch on; in Firefox, default 8.3 / 11.5 / 19.1 and 57.8 / 57 / 60 with the
switch on. The same within run-to-run spread — so the restored blur costs nothing measurable **in Chrome**
(1440 and 390, 4× and 6×). The Firefox rows cannot price it: headless Firefox accepts `backdrop-filter` into
the computed style and then composites it away, so forcing the phone nav to `blur(40px)` or to `none` there
produces screenshots identical to the pixel, while a plain `filter: blur(6px)` on the same element moves 6 %
of them. If the nav, the dialogs or the command palette feel slower on a real Firefox after this release,
that is the one thing in it that could do it, and Reduce effects turns the blur off.

In short: with the switch on, the library goes from 38.8 to 60 fps in Chrome at 4× and from 7.6 to 57.9 in
Firefox, and from 184 composited layers to 24. Where the frames went, taking one effect away at a time on
the library at 1440 (Chrome at 4×, the pre-release audit): removing the grain alone took it from 37.7 to 55.2
fps, removing all three background layers to 60. In Firefox nothing alone came close — the mesh was worth
the most (7.7 → 13.4) — and with everything else already off, the accent rims were the last big cost (32.1
→ 59.5), which is why the switch hides them too.

These are headless browsers standing in for a modest PC, not the PC: Chrome's throttle slows only the main
thread, and a weak GPU pays for blends and blurs in a compositor that throttle cannot see. The rig that
produced every number here is committed as `web/test/perf/` (not in CI — frame timings on a shared runner are
noise), with a README on how to run it, what it can and cannot say, and the traps it has already fallen into,
so the next report like this one is measured rather than guessed.

**The glass panels blur again (the one change to the default).** `.glass` and `.glass-strong` were written
unprefixed first and `-webkit-` second, and the build's CSS minifier read the second as overriding the first
and kept only it — a property Chrome and Firefox ignore. So outside Safari the phone nav, dialogs, the
command palette and the sign-in card were plain see-through panels. The unprefixed property now survives the
build, so every browser that supports `backdrop-filter` applies it; the owner asked for that fix in this
release, and a test runs the stylesheet through the same minifier so it cannot come back unnoticed. Verified
rendering in Chrome 152 — headless Firefox reports the blur in the computed style but composites it away, so
it could only be verified there at declaration level.

### Marking chapters you never downloaded (#69, @TIGamingTV)

The series page's grey rows — chapters the sources list that this server does not hold — can now be marked
read and unread: from the row's own **⋯** menu, or by picking them in **Select** mode, whose *Mark read* and
*Mark unread* now act on grey rows as well as chapters. A marked grey row shows a ✓ in its empty thumbnail
and the read dot, and stays grey, because the server still does not have it. It is for the reader who reads
elsewhere, or read long ago, and wants the page — and Mihon — to agree.

* **Mark all read** and **Mark previous as read** still mark only the chapters on the server: one tap must
  not tick eight hundred listed chapters, and a run of ticks is exactly what the trackers are told.
* A mark needs a connection but no download permission (it costs no bytes); offline it says *Could not
  mark — try again when online* rather than queueing.
* Marks write **no reading events**, so stats, streaks, the leaderboard and Wrapped do not move.
* When a marked chapter is later downloaded, the mark becomes ordinary read progress on it, keeping the time
  you marked it — stamped just before the file's own time, so the read-chapter cleanup never deletes a chapter
  the sweep has just fetched, or one you had started reading.
* Merging series carries marks to the survivor (the earlier of two marks on one number wins); **Forget**
  deletes them and counts a member whose only history was a mark among those who lose history; the library's
  bulk *Mark unread* clears them, and its bulk *Mark read* never creates them.

**What the trackers are told, and what they are not.** A mark reaches AniList, MyAnimeList or Kitsu only
with **Admin → Settings → Library housekeeping → Show missing chapters in Mihon** switched on, and only as
part of an unbroken run of read chapters from the start — never as a lone tick, because a number sent to a
tracker cannot be taken back there:

* chapters read here to 12, plus a mark on 1000: the tracker is told **12**;
* chapters read to 12, plus marks on 13–200: it is told **200**;
* a gap in what the sources list stops the run: a source listing only 951–1000, plus a mark on 951, still
  sends 12;
* a run ending on a fractional chapter is rounded down (12.6 sends 12);
* marking a chapter unread sends nothing, so the tracker stays ahead — the safe direction;
* Uchiyomi's own tracker sync still decides *finished* from chapters on the server alone; Mihon, reading the
  Komga API, counts the listed chapters as soon as you have marked one of them **on the series page**, and
  reaches *Completed* when you have marked the rest.

With the switch **off**, marks never reach a tracker, marking alone sends nothing, and the Komga API answers
exactly as it did in v0.42.0. With it on, Mihon's last-read number is the higher of v0.42.0's (missing
chapters skipped) and the run through your marks — never lower than before — and a sync from the phone up to
chapter N also marks every listed missing chapter at or below N here, so the phone and the series page agree.
Those phone-written marks are treated as the echo they are: Mihon sends that sync on every bind and refresh,
so they never switch your counts to the listed chapters (a series you had finished would have gone from
*Completed* to *Reading* on its own), and they reach a tracker only when the phone marked something above
everything you have finished here — a refresh repeating the server's own answer sends nothing at all.

Also fixed on the way: the listing matched a chapter by its file's number rather than an admin's correction,
so a chapter renumbered from 0 to 105 was also shown as a grey row at 105. It uses the corrected number now.

### Notifications beyond this browser (#70, @TIGamingTV)

**Admin → Settings → Notifications** (a new, last section) sends new chapters and server problems somewhere
other than this browser's own notifications. Four kinds ship:

* **Webhook** — a JSON `POST` (`event`, `title`, `message`, `count`, `series`), with an optional token sent as
  `Authorization: Bearer`;
* **Home Assistant** — its address, a long-lived access token and a `notify.<service>` name;
* **ntfy** — a server (ntfy.sh when left blank), a topic and an optional token;
* **Discord** — a channel's webhook address, with `@everyone` and every other mention switched off.

**Telegram and email do not ship, on purpose.** Telegram needs a chat id obtained by hand through its API and
puts the bot token in the URL path; email means a new dependency, server/port/TLS/login settings, and the
biggest support burden in self-hosting. The webhook reaches both through a bridge (n8n, Node-RED, Apprise).

**One message per update, not one per chapter.** After each library sweep — the scheduled one, or **Run now**
on it under Admin → Tasks — every target that wants new chapters gets **one** digest: *3 new chapters in Walk
Tale*, or *12 new chapters in 4 series*. The message is a template you can change, with `{count}`, `{series}`
and `{list}` (up to ten titles, then *…and N more*), and a live preview. Nothing is sent when nothing landed,
and a series' own *Check now* sends nothing (its result is already on your screen). A target can be aimed at
one person, who then hears only about their own favourites. **Include 18+ series** is off by default, like an
OPDS link's and an API token's *Include 18+ libraries*: a digest leaves titles from 18+ libraries out unless
the target asked for them. A person's target is bounded by that person's own libraries and age limit as well —
permissions the checkbox cannot widen — so it never names a series they could not open. **Server problems** — a source refusing this server, the
Cloudflare solver, extensions — go to the targets that ask for them, the same notices admins get as web
push, and they arrive even on an install without push configured.

**What keeps it safe.**

* Addresses on your own network are **allowed on purpose** — a Home Assistant lives at
  `homeassistant.local` or `192.168.x.x`, exactly what the cover proxy's address rule refuses, so that rule
  is deliberately not used here.
* `http` and `https` only, and no `user:password@` in an address.
* Cloud-metadata addresses (169.254.0.0/16, `fe80::/10`, `fd00:ec2::254`, 100.100.100.200,
  `metadata.google.internal`, `metadata.goog`) are refused when a target is saved **and** at every send, on
  every address the name resolves to, inside the connection's own lookup — so a name cannot resolve public
  when checked and to the metadata service when connected.
* **A redirect is never followed.** A target that answers 302 has failed, and the address it pointed at is
  never asked; that one rule is what stops a public host bouncing a Home Assistant token somewhere else.
* This server's own port on loopback, or its own public address, is refused.
* A ten-second timeout, and one retry thirty seconds later on a network error, a 429 or a 5xx — never on
  another 4xx.
* Every address and token is **encrypted at rest** under a key of its own (derived from `JWT_SECRET` with a
  salt used for nothing else), and is never logged, never in the audit feed and never sent back to the
  browser: the panel shows scheme and host only, and changing one means typing it again. **A stored token
  never follows an address to another host** — re-point a target and it asks for the token, and an ntfy
  topic, again, so a re-point plus a test cannot be used to read back a secret the panel never shows; the
  audit row for an accepted re-point records the new host. If `JWT_SECRET`
  changes, a target sends nothing and says *The stored address and token could not be read — enter them
  again*, rather than sending without its token.
* **Send a test** works only on a saved target — an address in the request is ignored — at most five a minute
  per admin, and it answers with a short reason, never the target's own response. (An admin can still save a
  target anywhere on the network and test it, which is why all of this is admin-only.)
* After ten failed deliveries in a row a target switches itself off and the admins are told once; switching
  it back on gives it ten fresh tries.

### Notes

New in the API, all described in `docs/api.md` and `bff/openapi.yaml`: `POST` / `DELETE
/api/series/:id/listing-progress` (1–500 numbers, each 0–1,000,000), `read: true` on a listing ghost the
caller marked, the ghost-inclusive `booksCount` on the Komga v1 series for a reader who has marked one, and
the admin-only `/api/admin/notify-targets` routes with their `NotifyTarget` shape. `reduceEffects` is one
more key in the free-form `/api/settings` object. Two tables are created on start (`listing_progress`,
`notify_targets`), with no data migration; there is no new environment variable. Existing clients may ignore
every new field.

What was verified: the web suite at 394 tests, the web and server type-checks and a production build, all
clean. Every guard added here carries, as a comment, the exact edit that puts its bug back, and was run that
way. The release image itself was built and driven in a browser: the main browser suite (72 checks) on seven
fresh instances, and a new walk for this release, 73 checks at 1440 px and again at 390 px on an instance of its own
each — the default look's three background layers computing exactly v0.42.0's styles and the glass computing
its blur, the switch removing every layer and every blur and surviving a reload from the account alone, the
library scrolling at 60 fps at a 4× throttle with the switch on (the walk's floor is 50), a grey row marked
from its menu and from select mode and the Mihon answer moving with the ghost switch on and not with it off, a
mark becoming read progress when its chapter lands, and a webhook target receiving exactly one digest for a
sweep while a target that answered 302 had its redirect ignored and the token turned up nowhere in the page,
the API, the audit feed or the server's log. The v0.40.0, v0.41.0 and v0.42.0 walks are unchanged at 41, 54
and 64 checks, each on its own instance; the layout rig found no overflow at four widths, and the language rig
rendered all nine languages and reported every file complete.

## v0.42.0 — 2026-09-23

Four bugs, reported by **@Squeaks72** with diagnoses accurate down to the line number (#64, #65, #66, #67),
and one feature contributed by **@TIGamingTV** (#58). Three of the four were live on the maintainer's own
library. The only default that moves is the first one, and it moves to what the setting had always said it
did; the contributed feature is off until you turn it on.

### Discover honours *Show 18+* (#64)

The 18+ reveal hid adult libraries and then let Discover list adult **providers** anyway — their names, their
newest covers, their popular walls, and a cross-source search that queried them. On the maintainer's own
server that is twelve of the fourteen sources switched on, painted on the one screen where things appear
without being asked for.

With the reveal off, an adult source is now left out of the provider list and its sheet, its *Newest* and
*Popular* walls answer nothing, and **the search across all your sources does not even ask it** — no request
leaves the server for that site. **Show 18+** now sits on Discover as well, beside *Newest from your
sources*, and stays there while you search; it appears whenever something is being hidden, so an install
with adult providers and no 18+ shelf still has the switch. Three things are deliberately untouched, because
you named them yourself: opening a provider's page for one title, adding it, and *Find missing chapters* on
a series whose own source is adult — hiding those would stop a series you already own from being filled.
An age limit below 18 is a different thing and is unchanged: those sources are refused by name, with or
without the reveal.

### Adding a series back no longer downloads it again (#65)

*Remove from library* keeps every file, so adding the series back should cost nothing — and instead it
fetched the entire back catalogue and then listed every chapter twice, because the only "do we have it"
check was a filename in Uchiyomi's own download folder. A read-only library the server never downloaded was
invisible to it: 33,854 chapters here, 18,064 of them (53 %) under names that check could not have matched
anyway, and 30 series that exist **only** there — 654 chapters for the largest of them.

An add now reads what the library actually holds, on every root and whatever the files are called, and
fetches only what is missing. With nothing left to fetch the dialog says *All {n} chapters are already in
your library* instead of starting a download, and the series still gets its source, its chapter floor, its
chapter list and its cover. A chapter you removed with **Delete from server** or **Delete files** is
deliberately fetched again: the nightly sweep treats that tombstone as kept so it does not undo a deliberate
deletion, but an add is somebody asking for the chapter now. A partial re-add fetches exactly the
complement, and the floor still records what you asked for rather than what was left to do.

### *Open in library* opens the series you just added (#67)

The add now answers with the id of the series it landed on — the one it found, minted, revived or stamped —
and a download's id appears on its progress card as soon as the first chapter is scanned in. *Open in
library* uses that. It used to search for the title and open the first result, which on a library with two
similarly normalised titles is a confident wrong answer; the search is now a last resort, needs an exact
match, and otherwise lands on Downloads rather than guessing. The duplicate prompt gains an **Open it**
button for the copy you already have. An id is never handed to somebody who may not open that series.

### A title you can actually type (#66)

*Remove from library*, *Delete files* and *Forget* ask you to type the title, and compared it byte for byte —
so any title carrying a character a keyboard does not produce could not be confirmed at all. That is 38 of
241 series here (16 %): curly apostrophes, en and em dashes, an `&amp;` the source never decoded, a
non-breaking space.

Both sides now go through one fold: one layer of HTML entities, NFKC, curly quotes and dashes folded to
ASCII, invisible characters and emoji dropped, every kind of space collapsed to one, ends trimmed. **Case is
not folded** — it is visible, and the same dialog confirms deleting a member. The server applies the same
function as the button, so the fix cannot turn a dead button into a refused request. A **Copy title** button
now sits beside the box wherever the browser offers a clipboard (over plain `http` on a LAN it does not, and
the button is hidden rather than broken).

### Missing chapters in Mihon, if you want them (#58, @TIGamingTV)

**Admin → Settings → Library housekeeping → Show missing chapters in Mihon**, off by default. Mihon works
out how many chapters a series has from the list Uchiyomi hands its Komga extension, so it counts what is on
disk. With this on, the chapters this server does not hold — the tombstones the read cleanup emptied, and
the numbers the sources listed that were never fetched — are listed beside the ones it has, in number order,
marked *not downloaded*, and their numbers count towards the chapter total Mihon reports to AniList and MAL.
They cannot be opened: tapping one gets Mihon's own empty-chapter message rather than a placeholder page,
because viewing a page would mark the chapter read.

It is for libraries that deliberately hold less than the sources list — the read cleanup, series you follow
without fetching, a chapter floor. It is **not** a fix for a bug on an ordinary install: the tracker's read
counts were always right, and what was short was the chapter list on the phone and the total beside it. A
series you have finished still reports *Completed*: a chapter that can never be read is listed, never
counted. Nothing outside the Mihon surface moves — the app, OPDS and offline reading list what is on disk
exactly as before — and turning the switch off puts every answer back at once.

The feature, the design and its tests are TIGamingTV's, merged with five review fixes on top: the chapter
counts stay over real chapters (counting a ghost would have made *Completed* unreachable for good, since
Mihon derives the status from those counts), a chapter an admin renumbered is listed once rather than twice,
a tombstone reports no pages like a ghost does instead of advertising the pages of a deleted file, the
documented id format now matches the one the code emits, and the setting is read only on the requests that
can use it.

### Notes

`hiddenAdult` on `GET /api/sources`, `seriesId` and `alreadyHere` on the add's answer, `id` in its 409
`existing`, `seriesId` on a job card, and the folded `confirm` on *delete-files* and *forget* are all in
`docs/api.md` and `bff/openapi.yaml`. Existing clients may ignore every new field. `FAKE_SOURCE_NSFW` is a
test-harness knob and does nothing on a real server.

What was verified: the whole bff suite on a fresh database — 157 files, 1,668 tests, none failing — the web
suite at 371 tests, the web type-check and a production build, all clean. Every guard added here carries, as
a comment, the exact edit that puts its bug back, and was run that way against the unmodified code before
the fix was taken. Three browser walks, each on its own throwaway instance: v0.40.0's, unchanged at 41
checks; v0.41.0's, unchanged at 54; and a new one for this release, 64 checks, run at 1280 px and at 390 px,
that drives all five items end to end — the reveal hiding a provider, with the test source's own request log
proving it was never even asked; a capped account still refused that source by id; a series removed and
added back with not one page fetched and the dialog saying so; a chapter deleted from the server fetched
again; *Open in library* landing on the id the server gave; a curly-apostrophe title confirmed with a
straight one, through both the button and the route; and the ghost switch on and off against Mihon's own
status arithmetic. The eight translations were merged, the language rig rendered all nine and reported every
file complete, and the layout rig found no overflow at four widths.

## v0.41.0 — 2026-09-22

The Health page has always been honest about what is wrong with a library and useless about fixing it:
fourteen chapters that downloaded as a two-page notice, forty gaps, a hundred and eighty-three chapters that
would not download, four sources blaming the Cloudflare solver — every one of them a sentence, and nothing to
press. This release gives every finding the button that fixes it, and does most of them overnight without
being asked. Nothing that cannot be undone became automatic.

### A nightly repair, bounded by numbers

**Admin → Settings → Library housekeeping → Repair the library nightly** is on by default and listed as
**Admin → Tasks → Repair library** with a *Run now*. Every 24 hours, counted from the end of the last
completed run, it does five things and nothing else, in this order:

* **Resets stale Cloudflare state** when sources are blaming the solver: the remembered sessions, the "could
  not be solved" marks, and cooldowns that lapsed more than 24 hours ago. While the solver itself is down
  nothing is cleared, because those cookies could only be re-earned by a solve that cannot happen. No site
  is contacted.
* **Counts pages** in up to **2,000** chapter files nobody has opened. A page count used to be stamped only
  when somebody first opened a chapter, so on a real install 30,625 of 43,253 chapters had no count at all
  and the short-chapter check could not see them. A file that turns out to be unreadable keeps a count of
  zero and is never opened again.
* **Gives failed chapters a second chance**: up to **100** ledger rows that hit the retry cap more than
  **7 days** ago have their attempt count cleared, so the chapter sweep tries them again now the site has
  had time to calm down.
* **Replaces a one- or two-page chapter when another source has a longer copy** — up to **20** a night, one
  copy from each of at most **3** sources the series follows plus one search, and only ever a file Uchiyomi
  downloaded itself. The decision is made from the page lists *before* anything is downloaded, so a shorter
  copy can never overwrite a longer one. When nothing longer exists the chapter is **marked confirmed
  short** instead, and only when every copy really answered *two pages*: a source that was silent, in a
  cooldown, left unasked by that cap of three, or that handed back an empty page list ends the proof and the
  chapter is looked at again another night. Silence is never agreement.
* **Searches for a source that can fill a gap**, for the **5** series with the largest holes, at most once a
  day each, fetching up to **20** chapters. A hole a followed source already lists is left to the chapter
  sweep instead. A source is followed only under the same title-and-90%-numbering rule as every other
  automatic follow.

One run may start **5** searches in total, shared between the steps that need one, of which the short step
may spend at most **2** — a library full of short chapters can no longer leave the gap step with nothing.
The repair and the chapter sweep never run at the same time — both download into the same folders — so
whichever starts second waits ten minutes. Turning the nightly off stops the schedule only: *Run now* and
the Health page's buttons keep working, because nothing it does is destructive.

**The nightly never deletes a chapter, never marks one as gone, never merges two series and never renumbers
anything.** Duplicate series and impossible chapter numbers stay one-click actions you confirm: *Merge* per
pair (and *Merge all* for the check) behind a dialog that lists each pair and marks the copy that is kept,
and *Delete chapter(s)* behind its own, with a bookmarked chapter refused. There is deliberately no
*Fix all* for either.

### Every finding has a button

*Fix* looks at one short chapter now. *It's fine* records that it really is that short, and a greyed row's
chip reads *Not fine* so you can take it back. *Fill now* searches for one missing run of chapters. *Retry
now* clears a source's attempt counts whatever their age and re-checks up to ten of its series. *Test*,
*Clear block* and *Turn off* act on a source. *Reset solver sessions* clears the Cloudflare state this
server is holding — it does not restart the solver, because Uchiyomi has no access to other containers, by
design. A check whose step the nightly can run also gets *Fix all* in its header.

**A chapter that gets replaced keeps everyone's reading position and bookmarks.** If you had finished the
two-page version it stays finished; open it again to read the rest.

### The checks themselves got more careful

Gaps and impossible chapter numbers now honour renumbering and deletions: a chapter you renumbered is read at
the number you gave it, and a deliberate deletion is no longer reported as a hole — while a chapter whose
file went missing still is. A gap the nightly has already searched for is shown greyed with what it found
(*no other source lists them, checked 2026-09-21*) and becomes a finding again after a week or as soon as
the series changes. A finding greys only when the answer was no — nobody else lists them, the series already
follows as many sources as it may, or searching other sources is switched off — never because a run did not
get round to it: a series the nightly had no search left for keeps its place in the queue instead. A failing
source **no series uses** is listed for reference rather than as a fault; ten of the twelve not-ok sources on
a real install are Discover-only noise nobody can act on.

### Chapters a source keeps refusing

A chapter the same source has refused on **two separate sweeps** — a 403 or a 429 both times — is searched
for on another source on the third try. A single refusal is still answered by waiting, because a busy site
is not a reason to put load on someone else, and a refused chapter is still never saved with pages missing.

`REPAIR_HOURS`, `REPAIR_COUNT_MAX`, `REPAIR_SHORT_MAX`, `REPAIR_GAPS_MAX` and `REPAIR_PACE_MS` are in
`docs/CONFIGURATION.md`; the task route, its body, its result and the new Health item fields are in
`docs/api.md`. Existing clients may ignore all new fields.

What was verified: the whole bff suite — 156 files, 1,620 tests, none failing — including new integration
tests for the repair (count, short, gaps, failures, solver, concurrency and a static guard that the
nightly's own code contains no delete, rename, merge or tombstone), its routes and the Health items; the web
suite at 358 tests, the web type-check and a production build, all clean; and four browser-walk legs, each
on its own throwaway instance — v0.40.0's walk, unchanged and still green at 1280 px and 390 px (41 checks
a leg), and a new one that drives this release end to end at both widths (53 checks a leg): a two-page
chapter found, fixed from a second source with its reader's completed mark intact, a second one confirmed
short by both sources and un-confirmed when its file changed, a gap searched for and filled, a chapter
refused across two sweeps and hunted on the third, and the task's schedule, result line and switch. The
eight translations were merged and checked against the components that render them. The language rig itself,
and the live run on the owner's own library, are the last steps and are not claimed here.

## v0.40.0 — 2026-09-22

This is a reliability release for finding and fetching chapters from real-world sources: some are slow,
some rate-limit bursts, and an otherwise good chapter can have one broken image. Discover now shows useful
results as soon as they arrive instead of waiting on the slowest provider, and the downloader preserves as
much of a chapter as it safely can instead of treating every imperfect fetch as all-or-nothing.

### Discover answers progressively

**Search all sources** now returns within six seconds at most, or 1.5 seconds after the first useful answer,
and keeps filling the same result set in the background. The source rows say which providers answered,
failed, timed out, were disabled, are cooling down, or are still pending. Repeating the request polls that
work instead of starting it again; normalised terms are cached for five minutes (up to fifty searches), with
at most twelve cards from each source. Every response is filtered again for the viewer, so a shared cache
never shows or starts an adult source for an account that cannot reach it. Source detail is cached for ten
minutes and duplicate lookups collapse into one request, which lets the add dialog pre-warm its first two
providers without doubling their traffic.

### Downloads slow down, switch sources, and keep repairable chapters

A valid image smaller than 256 bytes is accepted when Sharp can decode it. When a source answers 429, its
download pace rises through four levels, uses one page worker, doubles the gaps up to four seconds, and only
decays one level after ten quiet minutes. The current chapter resumes after 5, 10 and 20 seconds, always
honouring a longer `Retry-After`. If an ordinary fetch fails, Uchiyomi tries at most two copies from sources
the series already follows. It never overrides a copy somebody explicitly picked. A 403 or 429 never
becomes a partial chapter or starts a hunt; the refusing source cools down, while a copy on an already
followed source can keep the queue moving. Download job cards report every switch and distinguish a
rate-limited switch from an ordinary failure.

When at least 80% of a chapter arrives, Uchiyomi can save it with indexed placeholder pages and an internal
repair manifest. The chapter row shows how many pages are missing; the reader leaves the placeholder visible
with a caption, including when that page was also marked repeated, and offline copies keep the same evidence.
The nightly completion pass repairs only the missing indices, at most ten partial chapters per run, then
removes the partial mark when the chapter is whole.

### A bounded source hunt

**Admin → Settings → Updates & schedules → Look for failed chapters on other sources** is on by default.
After an ordinary failure, the scheduled sweep may search up to six eligible sources and follow one that
matches the title and at least 90% of the known chapter numbering. A series is hunted at most once per day,
only five hunts start in one sweep, and at most two extra sources are followed. Adult sources are eligible
only for an adult series. A refusal never starts a hunt. The source-health and job surfaces preserve the
reason for every switch or refusal instead of reducing the whole sweep to a generic failure.

The tuning knobs and additive API fields for progressive search, pacing, partial chapters, source switches,
and the hunt switch are documented in `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` and `docs/api.md`. Existing clients may ignore
all new fields.

## v0.39.0 — 2026-09-20

The profile page and the admin Settings tab, reorganised. The profile had grown by accretion: identity shown
three times, *Sign out* twice, a *Reading* tab that was mostly device settings plus one chart, an *Account*
tab of eight cards with two-factor, API tokens and the OPDS link each hidden behind an identical *Manage*
chip, and the reader's own defaults nowhere on it at all. The admin Settings tab mixed three ways of saving
— full-width *Save name* / *Save interval* buttons, switches that saved on their own with a toast, a tiny
*Save* chip and a dirty-tracked Save — under three-hundred-word paragraphs. Neither console remembered which
tab you were on across a refresh, and changing the language dropped you back on the first one. This release
is that cleanup, and nothing else: no new setting was invented, every endpoint and body is what it was, and
the reader, the library and the admin's other tabs are untouched.

### The profile: You · Settings · Connections · Account

Four tabs, each with an address. **You** is the hero, the badges, the lists and the reading studio (heatmap,
pace, by weekday — moved here from the old Reading tab, next to the things a reader looks at first).
**Settings** is four sections on one grid: **Appearance** (avatar, accent, language), **Reading** (the weekly
goal, then the reader's defaults — mode, theme, pages per view, repeated pages, fit, page gap, auto-scroll and
brightness — which until now could only be changed from inside the reader), **Downloads** (*Keep favorites
offline* with its per-series count, storage used, *Protect downloads*, and the way to the offline list) and
**This device** (new-chapter alerts and *Install Uchiyomi*, only where they apply). The reader defaults write
the same store the reader's sheet writes, so the two never disagree: the sheet still changes them for the
session you are in, and a series you have adjusted keeps its own memory, which wins. **Connections** is
everything that lets something other than this app read or write on your account: **Progress tracking**
(one row per service; *Connect* opens the token field under the row), **External readers** (the OPDS link,
its status, *Include 18+ libraries in this reader*, and a fresh link's URL, username and password shown once,
never behind a fold) and **API tokens** (*New token* opens the form inline, right under the heading; the text
now says that Mihon's Komga extension and the Uchiyomi extension use these). **Account** is who you are and
how you are signed in: **Signed in as** with *Change password*, **Two-factor authentication**, **Active
sessions** and **Sign out**. The *Admin and server settings* card and the second sign-out card are gone; the
rail keeps *Admin*, *Support Uchiyomi* and *Sign out*, and on a phone those sit as pills above the board.

### Settings save themselves and say so

One rule on both consoles now. A switch, a pill group, a colour or a slider saves the moment it changes; a
text or number field saves when you leave it or press Enter, and only if it changed (Escape puts it back; a
number outside its range is clamped and shows the clamped value; an empty number field reverts rather than
saving 0). The row says *Saving…* then *✓ Saved* beside the control, announced to a screen reader, and a
failed save shows the server's message in the same spot until the next change. There is no toast for a
setting any more — toasts stay for actions with side effects: revoking, generating, connecting, signing
other devices out, and the two admin switches that destroy or send something (the read-chapter cleanup and
the install count). On the settings tabs a *Save* button remains in exactly three kinds of place, on purpose: secrets (*Update
password*, *Verify and enable* for 2FA, *Create* for a token, *Generate OPDS link*), the scanlator lists on
the admin tab (*Save scanlator defaults*, one button for the two lists and the patience — a half-typed list
is not something to save on every keystroke), and the confirmation the read-chapter cleanup asks for.

### The admin Settings tab

Four sections in a fixed order. **Server**: the server name, *Open registration*, *Check for updates* and
the anonymous install count — each of the last two with a fold (*How this works*; *What is sent, once a day*
or *What would be sent, once a day*) holding the full explanation and, for the count, the exact request that
would be sent and the three promises about it. The fold is open while you are counted and opens when you
switch the count on, so the consent is on screen at the moment of consent. **Updates & schedules**: the
library update interval, the **backup time** — the nightly backup's hour was shown under Tasks and editable
nowhere; it is a field now (0–23, local time), and changing it re-arms the pending timer at once, so a change
at ten in the morning from 3 to 22 fires tonight at 22:00 rather than tomorrow at 03:00 — and, when an
extension engine is configured, *Update extensions automatically* with its check interval. **Library
housekeeping**: *Delete read chapters* and its *Wait (days)*; switching the deletion on still asks first,
with the count of chapters that would go, and a day count you have just typed is carried into that
confirmation so the job never runs at a number the row no longer shows. **Scanlators**: the blocked list,
the default priority and the patience, with the one Save.

### Both consoles remember the tab

`/admin/?tab=Settings`, `/profile/?tab=Connections` and so on: a tab tap rewrites the address in place (no
history entry, so Back still leaves the page), a refresh or a bookmark opens that tab, and a language change
— which rebuilds the whole page — lands you back on the tab you changed it from, which is the Settings tab
where the language lives, instead of the first one. The first tab is plain `/admin/` and `/profile/`.
`/profile/?tab=Connections&card=tracking` still scrolls Progress tracking into view, and the import page's
"connect a tracker" line points there. The Providers tab no longer renders the whole Extensions catalogue a
second time under its own cards; it has a link card that says how many sources the engine has enabled (or
that the engine is not running) and opens the Extensions tab.

### Paths that moved, for anyone following older instructions

**Profile → Connections → API tokens → New token** (was *Profile → Account → API tokens*, then *Manage*),
**Profile → Connections → Progress tracking** (was under Reading),
**Profile → Connections → External readers** (was under Account), **Profile → Settings → Language** and
**Profile → Settings → Reading** for the reader defaults, **Admin → Settings → Server** for the update check
and the install count, **Admin → Settings → Updates & schedules** for the extension update switch. The docs, the API reference, the OpenAPI
description, the import page and the health note that names the update check all say the new places, and
the test that checks every documented path against the console's own strings covers them. The eight
translations gained the new strings and lost thirteen that nothing renders any more.

What was verified: source guards for every rule above (the primitives' accessibility, the save-once-on-blur
rule, the one-Save-button rule, the tab hook writing `replaceState` and never re-reading in an effect, the
confirmation carrying the day count, the consent fold's labels, the reader defaults going through the
reader's own store, every new string present in all eight locale files), the backup hour end to end against
a database (PATCH 4, GET reads it back, the tasks list says *daily at 04:00*, 24 and −1 are refused), and
type-checking plus the static build. The release chain drives every row of both consoles in a browser at
1280 and 390 px before the tag; the screenshots in the docs still show the old screens and are listed as
stale in `docs/SCREENSHOTS.md` until they are re-captured.

## v0.38.0 — 2026-09-20

Two things TIGamingTV asked for. [PR #51](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/51) proposed a
Komga-compatible API so that Mihon's built-in Komga tracker could sync reading progress back to Uchiyomi —
the one thing the Uchiyomi extension cannot do, because Mihon lets only a tracker report reads. The PR was
not merged as written (its layer never set the cookie the tracker's credential-less requests ride on, so
Mihon could browse but never bind, and its username-and-password fallback reached an account with the
password alone, past two-factor and the lockout), but it was the spec for what is here, and the credit for
the idea and the endpoint list is his. And [#55](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/55), answered
in v0.37.0 with the question "should erasing a series for good become a button?", got its answer: yes, with
a typed confirmation and a dialog that says what it costs. Both ship.

### Read Uchiyomi in Mihon, and have what you read come back

Point the keiyoushi **Komga** extension at your Uchiyomi address with an API token as its API key, switch
Mihon's **Komga tracker** on under Settings → Tracking, and from then on a chapter read on the phone is
marked read here for that account, and a chapter read here is marked read in Mihon on its next refresh.
Uchiyomi answers exactly the Komga endpoints that extension and that tracker call — libraries, the series
list with its filters and sorts, a series, its chapters, pages numbered from one, covers and thumbnails, the
filter sheet's genres and authors, the account, and the tracker's two progress calls — with every field the
Kotlin client requires present, every date in the one format its strict parser accepts, and Spring's page
envelope complete, because one missing key or one `null` fails the decode of the whole list it sits in.
Collections and read lists are always empty there, on purpose: a personal collection can name a series the
token's account cannot open, and an id is a disclosure.

The sync is what the Komga protocol can carry and no more, and the docs say so plainly instead of promising
two-way sync: one number per series, the highest chapter in the unbroken run of read chapters from the
start — chapters 1, 2 and 4 read reads as *2* — moving forward only; there is no "unread" in the protocol,
so un-marking on either side does not travel. Mihon sends that number on every bind and every refresh, not
only after reading, so the server side is one set-based statement that skips chapters already complete,
writes no reading event (a sync from the phone is not reading in the app, and does not count towards
streaks, the leaderboard or Wrapped, like the app's own bulk mark-read) and pushes to AniList, MyAnimeList
or Kitsu once, only when something actually changed — otherwise a library update of two hundred bound series
was two hundred remote mutations. A fresh bind sends *0*, and in this library chapter 0 is not rare
(*Extra*, *Oneshot*, any file without a digit), so *0* is a no-op rather than a mark; nothing is lost, since
Mihon never reports a chapter it read as 0. Chapters deleted from the server stay out of the phone's chapter
list but keep counting for progress, because members' history refers to them.

The tracker itself sends no credential at all — only a User-Agent — and relies on whatever cookie the
extension's traffic left in the phone's cookie jar. So every request the extension authenticates leaves an
`UCHIYOMI-SESSION` cookie behind, and the tracker's requests are honoured on it. That cookie is built with
care, because the naive version was a hole: signed with the app's own JWT secret it would have verified as
a Bearer token for the whole API and as an image cookie, turning a read-only token into a seven-day write
session that survived revoking the token — and the phone replays the cookie to every port on the host. It
is instead a keyed MAC under its own derived key that nothing else on the server can verify, honoured only
by the Komga routes, naming the token row rather than the account, and the row is re-read on every use, so
revoking the token, letting it expire or disabling the account ends the phone's session on its next request.
It is not called `KOMGA-SESSION`: the phone's jar is keyed by host and name and ignores the port, so a real
Komga on the same machine — the migration case — would have overwritten ours and we theirs, both trackers
silently broken. With the API key field the cookie is re-minted whenever a request authenticates as a
different token, so switching the key moves the tracker with it instead of leaving the credential-less sync
writing the old account's progress; with username/password the extension only presents the password after
a 401, so a changed password is not noticed while the previous cookie is valid (up to 7 days) — revoke the
old token, or use the API key field, which is sent on every request. One Uchiyomi account per phone is the
inherent limit, shared with real Komga, and the docs say so, along with the other things a person should
know before relying on it: the token needs the **write** scope (a read-only token browses and reads, but
nothing syncs in either direction — Mihon retries a failed push a few times with backoff, then gives up
quietly until the next chapter read), the tracker must be on *before* a series is added, changing the
address later orphans every entry, the phone should not be pointed at a host where an untrusted service
also answers (the jar is shared per hostname, port ignored), and Tachimanga's *enhanced tracking* is
reported by a contributor to work against this API but was not tested here.

Only API tokens are accepted — as `X-API-Key`, as a `Bearer` token or as the Basic password, username
ignored — never an account password, never an OPDS token, never a session JWT; any presented credential
outranks a remembered cookie, no credential is a 401 with `WWW-Authenticate: Basic`, because that is the
one answer the extension's authenticator reacts to, and ten failed credentials from one address in five
minutes are answered 429 with `Retry-After` from then on, the budget the login form has. What the phone
sees is what the token's account may see: the library grants, the age limit and hidden series apply,
anything it may not see is a 404 rather than a 403, and an 18+ library is listed only to a token minted
with the new **Include 18+ libraries** checkbox (the extension has no reveal button of its own; the age
limit applies regardless, and the web app is unaffected). The sync was verified with a scripted client replaying the exact request
sequence the keiyoushi extension and Mihon's tracker make — cookie-jar semantics, strict Kotlin-style
decoding, the tracker's credential-less GET and PUT, a second account's key, a read-only token — against a
real instance; a report from a real device is welcome.

### Forget a series

**Content → Library**'s Removed list gains a third step after *Remove* and *Delete files*: **Forget**,
offered once no chapter row claims a file any more, behind the typed title, in rose. It is the one action in
Uchiyomi that erases a series from the database for good, and the dialog says exactly what that means:
*This erases the series and everyone's reading history on it — progress, bookmarks, notes, ratings,
favourites, tracker links. Stats and Wrapped change. If the files ever reappear it comes back as a new series
with no history. This cannot be undone.* The toast afterwards says how many members lost history on it.

It refuses, and says why and what to do, in every case where it would do harm: while the series is still in
the library; while any chapter row still claims a file (*Delete files* first); while a root cannot be read
at all (mount it first: nothing in Uchiyomi marks a chapter row whose file it cannot see — the verify task
refuses a root with no present file and *Delete files* reconciles only under the same proof — so an
unmounted share leaves every row live, and the live-row refusal is what stops a forget that would only have
the next scan bring the folder back as a new series, next to the history that was just erased); and while
the folder still holds chapters under any root. A chapter the verify task marked *missing* does not refuse:
that mark means verify proved the root was mounted and the file was not on it. A series that had absorbed
others by merge takes those rows with it in the same transaction, because leaving them would have flipped them live with no
chapters and a folder the next scan repopulates. History on chapters that moved to a merge survivor is never
erased: every per-member table is re-pointed to the chapter's current series first, deletes are keyed on the
chapters this series actually owns, and if a progress row or bookmark on someone else's chapter is still
filed here after that, the whole transaction rolls back and says so. Reading that code found that a merge
had been leaving **bookmarks** behind under the absorbed id since merge shipped (they still resolved, through
the chapter row, but were filed under a dead series) and dropping one side's tracker floor: a merge now
carries bookmarks to the survivor and keeps the higher of the two floors, so it never rewinds someone's real
AniList entry on the next push.

The review of this release found the step that made #55's own scenario impossible: a series whose folder
was removed by hand on the NAS had live chapter rows and no files, *Delete files* touched nothing, the
Removed row never offered *Forget*, and the route said the files were still on disk while nothing was. So
*Delete files* now reconciles a removed series' rows with the disk when the root is provably mounted — at
least one chapter file of any series is present under it, a present folder is not proof, and no more than
90 % of what was looked at is absent, the verify task's own rule — marking a live row with no file
*deleted from the server* and turning a *missing* mark into *deleted*; on a root that cannot be proven every
row is left exactly as it was. A hand-deleted folder can finally be forgotten. A merge survivor's *Delete
files* also removes the folders of the series merged into it, which used to stand empty and refuse
*Forget* forever with the *Delete files* chip already gone. The *users* count in the toast names members who
actually lose history, not someone who only opened the series page or whose tracker floor was carried to a
survivor. Typed confirmations compare trimmed and Unicode-normalised, so a title written on a Mac confirms
from any keyboard. And the typed-confirmation label is one translated sentence — it read *TYPGONE FOR GOOD
TO CONFIRM* in German — the Removed row is fully translated, and a long title wraps to two lines on a phone
instead of being cut.

### Security

Three findings from reading the token code for the cookie, all fixed. An access token, or any other JWT this
server signs, pasted into the `yomi_img` image cookie was an image session for that account, and the image
cookie pasted into an `Authorization` header was a full API session for seven days: every JWT verified under
the same secret with no check of what it was minted for. `authenticate()` now refuses a verified token that
carries a `typ` claim (access tokens have none; the image cookie and the OIDC ticket do), and the image
guard honours only a cookie whose `typ` is `img`. A disabled account's API tokens kept working — disabling
revoked the browser sessions and nothing else — and now stop with the account. And the image cache served
every image with `Cache-Control: public`, telling any shared cache in front that bytes authorised per viewer
were the same for everyone; it is `private` now, with every max-age exactly as before. While there, a
chapter thumbnail already warm in the cache was handed to a member whose age limit or library grants should
have hidden it, because the visibility check ran inside the producer the cache had already skipped; the
check now runs first. The review of the release added six more, all small: a disabled account's OPDS token
kept opening the feed and every page under `/img/*`, and now stops with the account like its API tokens; a
`Bearer` token on the Komga-compatible routes was ignored, so a remembered cookie for another token silently
answered in its place — it is now a credential there, and any `Authorization` header that does not resolve
is refused rather than outranked by a cookie; failed API keys on those routes are rate-limited per address
(ten in five minutes, then 429 with `Retry-After`; valid keys, cookie-only requests and requests with no
credential are never counted); signing out of the web app clears the `UCHIYOMI-SESSION` cookie too; the
session cookie accepts exactly one encoding of its expiry (a leading zero used to verify under the same
MAC); and the tracker's PUT refuses a number above 1 000 000 000 with a 400 instead of a 500 from Postgres.

### For the API

`/api/v1/*` and `/api/v2/*` are the Komga-compatible surface — twenty-four operations, each in
[docs/api.md](docs/api.md) and the served spec under the `komga` tag with four security schemes
(`komgaApiKey`, `komgaBearer`, `komgaBasic`, `komgaSession`), every one answering **429**
`too_many_requests` with `Retry-After` after ten failed credentials from one address in five minutes.
`GET /api/v1/series/:id/books?unpaged=true` is one page with no 500 cap (`size` = the chapter count, at
least 1, `number` 0, `first`/`last` true, `totalPages` 1 or 0), and `KomgaBook.sizeBytes`/`size` are the
real file size (`lib_books.size`; 0 / `0 B` when never stamped) rather than a padded zero, so the
extension's default chapter name no longer reads *(0 B)*. `PUT /api/v2/series/:id/read-progress/tachiyomi`
takes `0 ≤ lastBookNumberSortRead ≤ 1000000000`, else **400** `bad_request`. `POST /auth/logout` also
clears `UCHIYOMI-SESSION`. `POST /api/tokens` takes `showAdult` (default false) and `GET /api/tokens`
rows carry it. `POST /api/admin/series/:id/delete-files {confirm}` reconciles absent rows under the mount
proof and answers `files: 0` for a hand-deleted series; `POST /api/admin/series/:id/forget {confirm}`
answers `{ok: true, books, absorbed, users}`, **400** `confirm_mismatch`, **404**, or **409** `refused
{message, fix}` with one of `live`, `live_books`, `missing_files` (a root that cannot be stat'ed),
`folder_present` (a folder that still holds chapters) or `stranded`; both compare `confirm` trimmed and
NFC-normalised; it writes one `series.forget` audit row with `{id, title, folder, books, absorbed,
absorbedIds, users, rowsByTable}`. `api_tokens` gains `show_adult`. Every image under `/img/*` is
`Cache-Control: private`. The Uchiyomi Mihon extension is unaffected; the two can be installed side by
side.

## v0.37.0 — 2026-09-19

The inbox after v0.36.0, all of it from TIGamingTV: [PR #53](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/53),
bulk actions for the Library page, rebuilt here under the house rules rather than merged as written;
[PR #56](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/56), a correct diagnosis of why an extension source kept
reporting an error it no longer had, merged with fixes on top; [#54](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/54),
the extension that stayed *unhealthy*, whose real cause turned out to be a compose file; and
[#55](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/55), which asked for more control over the database and
over deletion, and gets the honest answer — the control exists, the docs hid it, and one delete was quietly
wrong. Plus four CodeQL findings and a Dependabot bump, each closed by a change rather than a dismissal where a
change was possible.

### The Library page can act on many series at once

**Select** on the Library page has a **Select all** chip beside *Done* now — it takes every series loaded so
far, since the grid loads as you scroll; scroll further and tap it again for more, and the bar's count says how
many are in hand. Two chips joined the bar. **Fetch newest**, for anyone who may download, grabs for each
selected series the newest chapter its sources list, if it is not on the shelf yet: one chapter per series,
whatever the series' *latest N* floor says, and without moving that floor — nothing below it is ever fetched,
so a caught-up series answers *up to date* instead of quietly back-filling its catalogue one chapter per tap.
It runs on the server as a job: the bar counts it up, you can leave the page (*Cancel* stays live and only
stops watching), and the toast at the end says what happened — *Fetched 3 chapters · 8 up to date · 1
skipped* — with a reason for every series that was skipped (its source disabled or cooling down, the chapter
held for your preferred group, a download already running for it, or the chapter deleted from this server on
purpose, where *Fetch again* on the series page is the way back) or failed (the source did not answer, the
chapter could not be saved). A source the admin disabled is never asked, and only a series whose source was
actually asked pays the pause between series. While the run is inside a series, that one series' own
*Fetch* answers *busy*, and no other. If the page loses the run — three status polls in a row unanswered —
it says *Lost track of the fetch* rather than summing up a run that is still going. A *Nothing yet* series,
and one that came in from a Mihon backup or a tracker list, are what this is for: the nightly check follows
them without fetching, and *Fetch newest* is how their latest chapter lands. **Remove from library**, for
admins (behind **More** on a phone, so the bar stays two rows), is the series page's *Delete* over a
selection and nothing more: it asks *Remove {n} series from the library?*, says in the dialog that **no files
are deleted** and everyone's progress, favourites and ratings are kept, hides them, and writes one audit line
per series with its title; a series already hidden or merged away is skipped and counted, and a selection
that hid nothing says *Nothing removed · 1 skipped* and keeps the selection so it can be corrected. Deleting
files stays what it was — one title at a time, only after a remove, against the typed title, on Content →
Library.

What PR #53 proposed, and what was redone: its *Select all* survives as it was. Its bulk delete hid and deleted
files in one request behind a typed `DELETE`, walked the read library too, and told the person their progress
was lost — it is now hide only. Its *download newest* fetched the newest chapter *missing anywhere*, which on
a caught-up Latest-N series is the highest chapter below the floor — it now takes the newest listed release or
nothing, honours group holds, disabled sources and age limits, and runs as a detached job with a status route
instead of holding one HTTP request open across up to five hundred downloads and a full scan. Its
reconcile-at-boot, which hard-deleted every chapter row whose file it could not see, is the verify task below,
which marks instead of deleting and never runs by itself. Its import fix landed on a route the app no longer
calls; the idea in it — a title merged into another series should read *already in your library* — is now in
the batch importer, mapped to the surviving series so a tracker link lands on the series that holds the
chapters.

### Verify chapter files, and a delete that told the truth only half the time

A backup holds the database and the config, never the chapter files, and a database restored onto a disk that
does not have them all came up with every chapter row intact and no bytes behind some of them — the updater
trusted the rows, so those chapters read *up to date* forever while the reader could not open them.
**Admin → Tasks → Verify chapter files** is the repair: it looks for every chapter's file and marks the ones
Uchiyomi downloaded that are gone as *deleted from the server* — the row and everyone's history stay — with a reason the updater does not
count as held, so the next sweep, or *Fetch newest*, downloads them again onto the same rows and nobody's place
moves. It marks only chapters Uchiyomi downloaded (under the download folder), because a re-fetch lands
there and nowhere else; a file missing from the read library is counted on the Tasks line and left alone,
for you or the engine to put back. It never runs at start-up or on a schedule, because a volume that is not
mounted looks exactly like a library with every file missing; for the same reason a folder with no file at
all behind its chapters, or with more than nine in ten of them missing, is reported as *looked unmounted and
was left alone*, never marked — an empty folder is not proof of a mount, since the downloader creates
folders while a share is down. It starts in the background — the toast says so — and the Tasks line shows
what it found when it is done, the unmounted warning first, and keeps it across restarts; the activity feed
records the counts.

Reading that code turned up the half-truth in *Delete files*: it removed the bytes and left the chapter rows
as live rows claiming them, so *Put back* afterwards restored a series whose every chapter 404'd, the updater
never fetched them again, and a second *Delete files* reported *Deleted N file(s)* for rows it had not touched.
Each row whose file it actually removes is now marked *deleted from the server*, the same mark the chapter-level
delete leaves — the Removed list says *files deleted* first on such a row's caption, a second line explains
that *Put back* lists the chapters as deleted from the server and that *Fetch again* on the series page brings
back the ones Uchiyomi downloaded (a read-library file is yours to put back by hand), the button stays a
plain **Put back**, and a second *Delete files* is not offered; the dialog counts the files it would actually
delete, not the chapter rows. A file that is already gone is left alone and not counted.

### The database was never hidden; the docs were

#55 asked for control over which database is used. That control has been one variable since v0.18.0 —
`DATABASE_URL` unset means the container runs its own Postgres, set means it talks to yours — and
**Admin → Overview** has said *embedded database* or *external database* in its header line all along. What was true is
that CONFIGURATION.md never mentioned the variable although it calls `.env.example` the authoritative list,
`.env.example` did not list it either, and the restore instructions in the user guide still piped into a
`uchiyomi-db` container that the default install has not had since v0.18.0. All three are fixed: a *Database*
entry in CONFIGURATION.md and `.env.example` that says where the switch is actually thrown (the compose file,
not `.env`), and a restore section written for the embedded layout first — over the socket, with a psql shell
and a scratch-database rehearsal — and the external one second. A new section, *Where your data lives and how
to delete for good*, states plainly what each delete keeps: *Delete* and *Remove from library* hide and keep
everything, and re-adding the same title revives the same row; *Delete from server*, the cleanup and *Delete
files* remove bytes and keep rows; a merge is one-way; and nothing today erases a series' rows from the
database, on purpose, because reading progress hangs off the chapter row and a delete must never take
someone's history with it. Whether that last one should become a button is the question back to the issue.
"How restricted the database should be" is not a knob and does not become one: admin-only, hide first, type
the title, never half-apply are the safety model, not a preference.

### The extension engine could never get past Cloudflare — and said so

#54 reported an extension stuck *unhealthy*. PR #56 found a real bug in the diagnosis: for an extension
source the live test result was thrown away before the verdict, so a source that had once stored a
Cloudflare-flavoured error kept reporting it on every sweep and every *Test* click, `ok: true` next to a
Cloudflare diagnosis, forever. Merged, with three things fixed on top: the probe no longer invents a status
of `0` for a homepage it never asked for (it has no `httpStatus` at all, and `0` keeps meaning "asked, no
answer"); both callers build the probe through one helper, with a test that reads both and fails if either
stops; and the Health page applies the same rule — a stored error older than the source's last success is
history, not a fix to go and apply, and no longer hides the live finding.

But the source in #54 was failing live, and the words in its log, `Cloudflare bypass currently disabled`, are
the engine's own: Suwayomi has no browser and has to be told about a FlareSolverr, and its bypass is off by
default — no compose file ever pointed it at the solver that was running beside it the whole time. Every
compose file now sets `FLARESOLVERR_ENABLED` and `FLARESOLVERR_URL` on the engine's container (the split
layout's engine also joins the app network, where the solver's name resolves), so an upgrade that recreates the
engine is the fix; the Unraid template's `SUWAYOMI_URL` note, extensions.md and CONFIGURATION.md say to set
both on any engine you run yourself, and that error string now diagnoses as a Cloudflare challenge whose admin
fix names the engine's switch rather than Uchiyomi's solver — by the names the shipped compose files use
(`uchiyomi-suwayomi`, `http://uchiyomi-flaresolverr:8191`), not the development stack's, since the admins
who read it are exactly the ones whose engine was not recreated from those files. The docs used to say the
engine solved Cloudflare itself. It does not, and they no longer say so. While there: the *Test* button and
the daily source check never read a source's slow streak, so *This source answers, but more slowly than it
is given* could only ever be reached from Discover's health view; both read it now, and the fix sentence
names the configured `SOURCE_LATEST_TIMEOUT_MS` budget.

### Security

The cover proxy's exemption for the extension engine is now one path shape, not one origin. `GET
/img/sources/cover?u=` fetches every URL through the SSRF guard except the engine's own covers, which live on
a private address by design — and since v0.26.2 that exemption was the whole engine origin, any path, fetched
with the engine's credentials, so any signed-in reader could make the server issue an authenticated GET to any
engine endpoint, and the difference between a 502 and a 500 said whether a path existed (CodeQL #24, critical).
Only `/api/v1/manga/<id>/thumbnail` is fetched now, rebuilt from the operator's `SUWAYOMI_URL` and the numeric
id, accepted only if it round-trips to exactly what the caller named; the caller's string itself is never
what goes on the wire, redirects from it stay refused, and the test that used to assert *anything at all on
the engine origin* is allowed now asserts the opposite. Extension covers are no longer refused by the cover
proxy when `SUWAYOMI_URL` ends in `//` or carries a query or fragment; the engine base is normalised once
for both the stored cover URL and the proxy's check. Two test-only findings were fixed in kind rather than
dismissed: an exponential regex over the docs' console paths (#26; 9 s at 28 arrows, now linear) and an XML
comment scan that an HTML rule kept misreading (#28; now a plain walk). #25 was dismissed: a 256-bit random
API token stored as its sha256 is not a password hash. Dependabot's adm-zip 0.6.1 ([PR #57](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/57),
CVE-2026-77301) is merged; the advisory was not reachable here — adm-zip is only ever constructed empty to
*build* archives, and untrusted archives are read by another library — and the guard test now asserts exactly
that premise, so the next advisory is answered by a test rather than by re-reading the tree. CI installs with
`npm ci` instead of `npm install`, so a lockfile bump is what CI actually verifies, and every job has a timeout
(the Tests job's is set from its measured 38–39 minutes, not a guess); a test pins both.

### Also

The v0.36.0 release push went red on one test that passed locally every time: the add-time auto-follow's wall
and a candidate's remaining budget were measured on two clocks that disagree by a millisecond or two, so a
source handed a sliver of the wall could finish inside it and be followed past the deadline. A candidate now
needs at least two seconds of wall left to be tried at all, and reads *not checked* otherwise.

Merging is transitive now. When a series that has itself absorbed others is merged, everything it absorbed
is re-pointed at the new survivor in the same transaction, so a title folded in two merges ago still counts
as owned by the final survivor — on the scan, where its folder's chapters keep filing under the survivor,
and in the batch importer, where a backup or tracker entry with that spelling reads *already in your
library* instead of being added again through another source. The German and Russian select-bar chips
are shorter (*Als gelesen*, *Прочитано*, *Новые главы*) so the bar is two rows on a 390 px phone in every
language.

### Not in this release

A *Forget series* action that would erase a hidden series' rows — its chapters, and every member's progress on
them — for good. It is the one thing #55 names that is genuinely impossible today, and it is possible to
build; it is not built until the issue says that is the ask, because the honest dialog has to warn that it
deletes everyone's reading history on that title. The Komga-compatible API from
[PR #51](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/51) moves to v0.38.0.

For the API: `POST /api/library/bulk/newest {ids}` (1–500) starts the Fetch newest job — **202** `{ok, total}`,
**403** `forbidden` without the download permission, **409** `busy` while one runs — and `GET
/api/library/bulk/newest` answers `{running, done, total, startedAt, results: [{id, title, outcome, reason?}]}`,
results for the starter and admins only; a newest chapter held only as a cleanup or Delete-files tombstone
is `skipped` with *Chapter N was deleted from this server on purpose. Fetch again on the series page brings it
back.*, and *Chapter N is already here.* means a live row holds it. While the run is inside a series,
`POST /api/sources/fetch`, `/api/sources/fill` and `/api/admin/series/:id/chapters/refetch` answer **409**
`busy` for that one series only. `POST /api/admin/series/bulk/hide {ids}` answers `{ok, hidden,
skipped: [{id, reason: merged | already_hidden | not_found}]}` with one `series.delete` audit row per series.
`POST /api/admin/tasks/verify/run` is detached like `update`: it answers `{ok: true, started: true}`
(`{ok: false, error: 'busy'}` while one runs) and the counts land on `GET /api/admin/tasks`, which always
lists `verify` with `lastResult: {ok, checked, missing, readLibraryMissing, unmounted, roots, ms, stopped?}`,
persisted in `server_settings.verify_last_run` / `verify_last_result` across restarts; the audit row
`library.verify` carries `{checked, missing, readLibraryMissing, unmounted, ms}`. `GET /api/admin/series/deleted` rows
carry `live_books` and `pruned_books`. `lib_books` gains `pruned_reason` (`null` = cleanup or pre-v0.37.0,
`'deleted'` = Delete files, `'missing'` = the verify task; only `'missing'` is not held by the updater), and
`POST /api/admin/series/:id/delete-files` marks the rows it unlinks. `POST /api/admin/sources/:id/test` always
carries `probe`, with `httpStatus` absent for a source that has no homepage, and its `diagnosis` can now be
`too_slow`. The Mihon extension is unaffected.

## v0.36.0 — 2026-09-19

The two things v0.35.0 said were next, both asked for by TIGamingTV: the first half of
[#48](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/48) — bringing a reading list over from the AniList,
MyAnimeList or Kitsu account already connected under Profile, through the review that release built — and
[#49](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/49), letting a freshly added series follow the other
sources that carry it, which until now meant opening *Find missing chapters* on every series by hand. The
shared chapter pool #49 describes has existed since v0.31.0; what was missing was the following.

### Bring your tracker list over

Uchiyomi pushes reading progress to AniList, MyAnimeList and Kitsu, and had never read anything back — so
the list that already knew everything you follow was no help in filling a new library. Now it is. On the
import page (**Admin → Providers** → *Import a list*), above the intake, a box lists every tracker you have
connected under **Profile → Reading → Progress tracking**, with five boxes for the lists to bring over —
*Reading* and *Plan to read* on by default, *Finished*, *On hold* and *Dropped* off — and **Load list** reads
that account's manga list with the token you already gave it and drops the titles into the same review as a
Mihon backup or a pasted list: matched against your sources in the background, one row per title with its
pick and how confident the match is, *Change* and *Skip this one*, and nothing added until you press *Import
selected*. Each entry is searched under the English title the service carries, on every source, and only
when that misses everywhere under its romaji and synonyms — a row that matched that way says *matched under
its other name*, so the second name is in view before you commit. Abbreviations the service lists as
synonyms (*AoT*, *SnK*, *MHA*) are never used as search terms: three letters are contained in almost any
title, and one such synonym matched a wrong series on the first source that lacked the right one. Light
novels are left out: all three services keep novels on the "manga" list, and a novel would match its own
adaptation and then be linked to the wrong work; the done line counts them, *· {n} novels skipped*. The
review keeps 500 rows, as every intake does, and a longer list says *(first 500 kept)* — the five boxes are
there so a large account can come over one list at a time. Nothing is written
to the tracker by the import, and nobody else's connection is read: the intake uses the connection of the
account that presses the button, and a token the service rejects switches that connection off and says so,
the same way a failed push does. A token that has merely lapsed is not sent anywhere: the intake says so
before asking the service, and leaves the connection in place with the same note a push would leave. Open
imports name the origin, *AniList list*, *MyAnimeList list*, *Kitsu list*, and a batch survives a closed
tab like any other — the novel count and the *(first 500 kept)* hint are on the batch itself, so a reload or
an *Open imports* tap shows them too. Batches are shared between admins, and a tracker batch stays its
owner's whoever presses *Import selected*: the links and the floors below are recorded for the account
whose list was read, never for the admin who happened to run it.

Every title that comes in is linked to its tracker entry, so the first chapter you finish syncs without a
visit to the series page — and so are the titles you already had. For anyone with an established library that
is most of the list, and it would have been the one outcome the import produced nothing for: those rows
start skipped, as before, but now read *Already in your library — linked for progress sync*, and the link is
made at intake, before the review, so it holds whether or not you import a single row. A list your library
already held in full skips the review and closes as done at once, and its done card says what happened
rather than *0 added*: the headline counts *· {n} linked for progress sync* and each such row reads *{title}
— linked for progress sync*. A title you had deleted earlier is not "already in your library": it resolves
like any other, and importing it puts the same series back, as adding it would. Which raised the one
thing that had to be right before any of it could ship: your list says you are at chapter 150, the first
chapter you open here is chapter 1, and a tracker accepts a lower number and rewrites the entry, with no
undo. So the import records what the tracker already says about each series for the account
whose list was read — a floor — and a chapter finished at or below it is skipped quietly, nothing sent and
nothing marked as an error, because nothing went wrong: the tracker is simply ahead, or already there. Only
once you pass it does a push go out. Every *Load list* takes the tracker's current number for each entry,
whatever stood there before, so a correction made on the tracker — a mis-click fixed from 150 down to 20 —
is taken by loading the list again, and pushes resume from 21; nothing is ever lowered on the tracker by
this app on its own. One case the floor cannot see: a *Finished* entry the tracker holds at chapter 0 gets
no floor, and the first chapter finished here may set it back to Reading. The first chapter you finish here
never rewinds your tracker's chapter count.

Kitsu links, on the way, became per person. Kitsu's push had always addressed one library entry by its id,
and a library entry belongs to a single account; no code path had ever created a Kitsu link, so nothing had
noticed that the first household with two Kitsu users would have had the second one's push land on the first
one's entry, be refused, and switch their connection off with a message blaming their token. The stored id is
now the manga's, and a push looks up — or creates — the pushing account's own entry for it. Three environment
variables, `ANILIST_API_URL`, `MYANIMELIST_API_URL` and `KITSU_API_URL`, point the adapters somewhere else;
they exist so a test instance can talk to a stub, and are documented as that.

### A new series can follow the other sources

Since v0.31.0 a series can follow more than one source, and the sweep takes each missing chapter from
whichever source has it first. Getting there was a detour: add the series, open it, run *Find missing
chapters*, wait for the scan, press *Also follow this source* on each candidate — for a title the add dialog
had found on four sources thirty seconds earlier. Now the dialog offers to do it at the add. When it already
holds the list of sources that carry the title — a *Trending* pick, which it searches your sources for; a
search result; a wall card that several of your sources published, the one with the *{n} sources* chip — the
options step shows, under the auto-update switch, **Also check the other sources that carry this title**,
remembered on this device once you set it. The switch is for admins: following a source is an admin act,
as it is on the series page, and a member's add goes through as if the switch were off — their done step
says an admin can follow the other sources from *Sources & translations*. A wall card only one source had
gives the dialog no list, so no switch: one dim line points at *Find missing chapters*, because searching
every source again behind each add
is exactly the load on other people's sites this app tries not to be. Nothing new is searched either way; the
sources the dialog already found are asked for the title's own page and chapter list, and that is all.

The judgement is the server's, not the dialog's, and it starts from the one *Find missing chapters* makes.
Once the series' own listing is written — right after the add on a *Nothing yet* add, once the
first chapter has landed on a download — each candidate is checked, at most six, within ninety seconds for
the lot; what does not fit reads *not checked — it took too long*. Two checks stand in for the human that
*Find missing chapters* has looking at each candidate. The candidate's own title must be the series' title —
exact, or one containing the other, other names allowed — or it reads *different title*. Then its numbering
must line up with the main source's listing, which must carry at least three numbers or there is nothing to
measure against: with an exact title and a listing of at least ten numbers, the candidate must list at least
90 % of them, and a copy that runs on past this one still follows; with a containing title, or a listing
shorter than ten, the numbering must agree both ways — at least 90 % of these numbers listed there, and at
least 90 % of its numbers listed here — because coverage one way cannot tell a dense sequel from the series
it continues: *Tokyo Ghoul:re* lists every chapter of *Tokyo Ghoul* and forty more, and a same-named work
three hundred chapters long covers a five-chapter listing entirely. Both read *numbering differs*, with the
lower of the two shares as the percentage, while *(Official)* at 22 chapters for 20 still follows. A source
that passes both is followed, up to two per series, and from then on the sweep takes new chapters from
whichever of them has them first. The done step shows the check as it runs — *Checking {n} sources — this
can take a minute. You can close this; anything followed shows under Sources & translations.* — then one
line per source, *Followed {name} — listed there as “{title}” · {pct} %* or *Not followed: {name} —
numbering differs* (or *different title*, *could not be reached*, *lists too few chapters*, *already
following two*), and *Followed {n} of {m}* under them. Closing the dialog loses nothing: the results ride on
the add's job card, and the *Sources & translations* sheet shows each follower with *followed for you* in
place of *also checked*, the × to stop following it as before. On Discover's strip of running fetches, a
*Nothing yet* add that asked for the other sources shows as *Checking other sources…* and then *Checked
other sources*, never as *Fetched*, and that card cannot be dismissed while the check runs. Should the check
itself fail before any source was asked, every candidate reads *not checked* rather than the dialog going
quiet. When the dialog's list held no other source, it says so — *None of the other sources checked lists
this title.* — never "no other source carries it", which it cannot know.

The user guide and the API reference used to say that a *Find missing chapters* plan was "deliberately the
only way in" to following. Both now say what is true: two ways in — a plan, or the add's own candidates — and
one judgement, made on the server either way; never a bare follow.

### Not in this release

A nightly pass that would do the same for every series already in the library is designed and not built, on
purpose: it would be one search on every source for every series, the exact load the add-time version
avoids by asking only what the dialog already found, and a wrong follow puts the wrong book's chapters under
the right name. The second half of [#48](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/48) shipped in
v0.35.0; the Komga-compatible API from [PR #51](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/51) is still
being rebuilt on the OPDS catalogue, as that release said.

For the API: `POST /api/admin/import/batches` takes a fourth intake, `{origin: 'tracker', tracker:
'anilist' | 'myanimelist' | 'kitsu', statuses: [reading | plan_to_read | completed | on_hold | dropped]}`,
reads the requesting admin's own connection, answers **422** `token_expired` for a lapsed token without
calling the service, and answers `skippedNovels` and `truncated` besides — both also on the batch row that
`GET /api/admin/import/batches` and `GET .../batches/:id` return; a candidate row carries `tracker`,
`external_id`, `alt_titles`, `matched_via` (the other name a match was found under; cleared by a manual pick)
and `linked`. `POST .../batches/:id/run` links and floors for the batch's owner, not the caller. `POST
/api/trackers/:provider/resync/:seriesId` now takes every provider (**404** `unknown_provider` otherwise)
and clears that provider's floor only; a 403 from a tracker is a sync error to retry, never a token verdict.
`POST /api/sources/add` takes `alsoFollow: [{source, sourceId}]`, at most six, from an admin (a member's is
ignored), judged after the listing is written; the add's job card on `GET /api/sources/jobs` carries
`autoFollow: {done, results: [{source, name, theirTitle, followed, coverage, why}]}`, a *Nothing yet* add
with `alsoFollow` leaves a finished job card so the results have somewhere to live, and `DELETE
/api/sources/jobs/:folder` answers **409** `running` while that judgement runs. `series.sources[]` gains
`auto` — true for a source followed at add time, false once a person confirms it. `GET /api/trackers` is
unchanged. The Mihon extension is unaffected.

## v0.35.0 — 2026-09-18

Two contributions, three days after v0.34.0, both taken through the same pipeline as everything else:
[PR #52](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/52) by TIGamingTV, the review step that
[#48](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/48) asked for when a library is brought over from
another app, and [PR #50](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/50) by hawwwwwk, which found that the
Unraid template could not be installed by anyone and laid the repository out so Community Applications can
list it. Both are below, each with what was fixed on top before shipping, plainly.

### Check each match before it lands

From [PR #52](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/52) by TIGamingTV, and the right design. Until
now *Import a list* read the titles out of a Mihon backup, a MangaDex list or a pasted list, searched your
sources for each one and added the first good hit — with no chance to see whether it had picked the right
manga before it was in your library. Mihon's own *Bulk Migration* screen does the obvious thing instead, and
so does Uchiyomi now: *Import a list* on **Admin → Providers** opens its own page, `/admin/import/`, which
matches every title against your sources in the background — a backup entry on the very source it came
from, when that source is installed here — and saves what it found in the database, so a closed tab or a
restarted server does not throw away the work. Then the review: one row per title, its pick and how
confident the match is, **Change** to open a manual search — one sideways-scrolling rail of results per
source, so you can see which provider a pick would come from, with the cover, title and chapter count of the
current pick beside whatever you tap — or **Skip this one**; rows already in your library start skipped,
visibly. **Needs attention** filters to the rows that want a look. **Select ready to import** and **Import
selected — {n}** do the adding, and every add is a *Nothing yet* add from v0.34.0: the title lands with its
listing and no chapter downloaded, so a few hundred titles is a few minutes of look-ups rather than hours of
fetching, and new chapters arrive through auto-update. Rows already imported are never re-added, so fixing
the leftovers and pressing *Import selected* again picks up only what is newly ready; once nothing is left —
every row imported or skipped — the batch is done on its own, and a batch a restart interrupted offers
**Resume**.

What was fixed on top before shipping. The one thing that could not go out as written was the matching: on the
same-source path, a title the source did not recognise was given the source's *first search result* — the
exact "wrong manga" fallback v0.34.0's matcher forbids — and labelled with the highest confidence, *same
source as before*, which kept it out of *Needs attention*. The backup carries each entry's catalogue address,
and the extension engine already returns it on every search result, so that is now the proof: only a result at
the backup's own address counts as the same entry; otherwise the usual title rules decide, and a title none of
them is confident about stays unmatched rather than becoming somebody else's manga. A batch interrupted while
importing was stranded for good — no resume, no cancel, nothing that ever cleaned it up — and deleting a batch
mid-match kept the server searching sources for it: an *importing* batch nobody is running now reads as ready
for review again, both loops stop when their batch is discarded, there is a **Discard** button at every stage,
batches left in review are dropped after thirty days, and the intake card lists the **open imports** — every
admin's, on an install with more than one, an interrupted batch marked as such — so none is orphaned by a
closed tab. A batch with a row left over, one title no source carries, say, could never finish: it sat in
that list for the thirty days with *Discard* as the only way out; now it closes on its own once every row is
imported or skipped. A title the library already held under another spelling was reported as *Failed —
duplicate*, in red, and counted as a failure: it reads *Already in your library*, and a row that could not be
added says why in words rather than as an error code. The review row never showed what a title had been
matched *to*, so a wrong pick was invisible without opening each row: it now carries a second line, *→
{matched title}*, dimmed when the two are the same, and a match that only *contains* your title, where the
names differ by more than an edition tag or the longer one looks like a season, part or novel of the other, is
listed under *Needs attention* too. Sixty-two of the page's seventy-six strings existed in English only; all
eight languages have them. Two batches could slip through the *one at a time* gate if started together, and
*Import* could be pressed twice on one batch: the gate now closes before the first thing it waits on, and the
second press is refused by the database itself. The intake text promised that nothing lands "until you press
Continue" while the button said *Import selected*, and "seconds of database work" was not true — each add
still asks the source — so the copy says what the button says and *a few minutes*. And the old one-shot
import, the textarea that added the first hit with no review, is gone from the page: the reviewed flow is the
only way in from the UI, and `POST /api/admin/import` stays for scripts.

### An Unraid template that installs, from a repository Community Applications can read

From [PR #50](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/50) by hawwwwwk, who had already sent the report
behind v0.21.0's *Unraid instructions that work*. Those instructions were right; the file they pointed at was
not. The comment at the top of the template, rewritten in that same release, said "never read `--`
downloadTemplates() returns", and two dashes inside an XML comment are illegal — so from v0.21.0 to v0.34.0
any XML parser, Unraid's included, refused the file at line nine, before the first setting, and nobody who
copied it onto their server could have installed anything from it. Every check on the template passed the
whole time, because none of them parsed it. He fixed the comment and laid the repository out the way Community
Applications expects a template repository to look — the template at `templates/uchiyomi.xml`, a
`ca_profile.xml` at the root with the description and icon — so the app can be submitted to CA from this
repository and installed from the **Apps** tab like anything else; until it is listed there, copying the file
into `/boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user/` works — with a file that now parses.

On top: the profile's icon now points at the app's own icon, the one the template shows, rather than a
logo option; the template's `TemplateURL` points at this repository, so Unraid refreshes it from here;
the install guide and README name the new path; the separate `unraid-templates` repository is kept only
so old links keep working and says so; and the release test now reads every comment in the template the
way a parser would, so a `--` can never ship again.

### Not in this release

TIGamingTV's other pull request, [PR #51](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/51), a Komga-compatible
API so Mihon and Tachimanga can sync read status with a server they know by name, is not merged: its goal
is the right one and its shape is the spec for the version that will ship, but as written the sync cannot
work (Mihon's Komga tracker relies on a session cookie the server never set), its password login bypasses
two-factor, lockout, rate limiting and the audit log, and read-only tokens could write. It is being rebuilt
on the catalogue the OPDS feed already exposes, with the PR as the specification and his credit on it. The
first half of [#48](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/48) — importing a reading list straight
from an AniList, MyAnimeList or Kitsu account into the same review — and the automatic following of extra
sources asked for in [#49](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/49) (the shared chapter pool it
describes has existed since v0.31.0; only the following is manual) are the next release.

For the API: `POST /api/admin/import/batches` (intake, starts matching), `GET /api/admin/import/batches`
(the open-imports list), `GET`/`DELETE /api/admin/import/batches/:id`, `POST .../:id/resume`, `POST
.../:id/run` and `PATCH /api/admin/import/candidates/:cid` are new, admin-only; a candidate carries
`match_title`; a non-UUID `:id` or `:cid` is a 404 rather than a 500. `POST /api/admin/import` is unchanged.
The Mihon extension is unaffected.

## v0.34.0 — 2026-09-15

The owner's verdict on v0.33.0, the evening it went live: the *Who scanlates this* card sitting open by
default on every manga page — "that's not cool for the UX" — and all the sources-and-extensions business,
on the series page and on Discover both, "is ruining the UX with too much text and unclear info on how it
works and what it does". He was right, and the numbers say so: at phone width, as an admin, the card alone
put about 115 words between *Start reading* and the first chapter, every chapter row carried up to three
bordered pills plus a *2 versions* pill on a line of its own, the chapter header ran five chips over two
rows, and the page used the word *download* for two different things. Every established reader — Mihon,
Kotatsu, Suwayomi, MangaDex, Comick, Paperback — does the opposite: the source is one tappable line in the
header, the group is a muted caption on the chapter row, and versions, filters and rules live behind a tap.
So that is what this release does. Nothing that v0.33.0 could tell you has gone; it has all moved one tap
away, and the page that is left says about half as much (≈235 words → ≈110 as admin on the same series,
≈174 → ≈105 as a member).

### One line instead of a card

The card is gone. In its place, between the title block and the buttons, one muted line: on a phone
*MangaDex · (AS)(FC)(JG) Asura Scans +2 · 4 not here yet ›* — the source's favicon and name, a stack of
three group avatars with the busiest group's name, and how many listed chapters this server lacks; on a
desktop the same line has room for *Translated by Asura Scans, Flame Comics (+1)* and *checked 2h ago*.
When a phone is too narrow for all of it — *Mangakakalot (Manganato)* as the source, say — the source's
name is the first thing cut short and the group's name the second; the count and the chevron never give,
and when even the busiest group's name will not fit, the avatars and *+n* stand alone. A shortened source
name is still the truth; a shortened count would not be.
The line knows its states rather than going blank: *not checked yet* on a series no sweep has seen,
*auto-update off* in place of the count when the updater is not watching this one, *Source not installed*
when the source it was added from is no longer on the server (never the raw source id), *Added from disk ·
no source* for admins on a series that was scanned in rather than added, and *{n} chapters listed · none
fetched yet* on a series with no chapter on disk at all (see *Nothing yet* below). A series with no source
and no group named on its files shows members no line at all. Sources that name no groups — the built-in
engines and sites added by URL — simply have no group segment.

Tapping the line opens **Sources & translations**, a sheet from the bottom of the screen with everything the
card had and the *Sources* list that used to be inside *Edit details*. Under **Sources**, one row per source
the series is checked against: favicon, name, *main* or *also checked*, *{n} chapters listed*, *checked
{ago}*, and *not installed* dimmed when it is. Admins get an × to stop following a source that is not the
main one, and two chips under the rows: **Check now** — one for the series rather than one per row, since a
check visits every followed source — and **Add one from Find missing chapters**, which closes the sheet and
opens that dialog — the only way in stays the only way in. Under **Translated by**, one row per
group in the order the card used (ranked first, then busiest, blocked last): the group's avatar and name, *{n}
releases · Ch. {a}–{b} · {n} on server*, its activity strip (next section), and **Show chapters**, which now
closes the sheet before it scrolls the list to the chip you tapped. **Prefer**, the ▲▼ arrows and **Block**
are on the rows, and they **apply on the tap**: each one is saved as you press it, with a *Saved* toast, so
there is no draft to lose by tapping the backdrop — the v0.33.0 card's "toggled Block and left the page"
trap is closed. Patience is the one thing still typed, so it lives in the sheet's footer, which stays in
view while the rows scroll, as one compact row: **Patience** and its number of days, the value the series
currently uses, **Save** for that field alone, and **Use server defaults**. The two sentences that used to
sit around the field — preferred groups first, blocked ones never; blank means the server default, 0 takes
the best copy at once — are the input's tooltip and a line of the (i) explainer instead: with them the
footer ran to 172 px and pushed every *Translated by* row off a small phone. Members see the two sections
and no controls. *Edit details* keeps only the auto-update switch and a pointer: *Translation groups are
ranked in Sources & translations*.

Nothing on the series page is open by default any more. The rules themselves — a preferred group's copy is
taken first, a blocked group's never while another exists, a new chapter waits for a preferred group for the
patience — have not changed at all.

### Rows say less

A chapter row's second line is now one muted caption instead of a row of pills: *(AS) Asura Scans · via
MangaPark · 2 versions* — the group as a small avatar and its name, *via {source}* only when the chapter came
from a source other than the main one, *{n} versions* as plain text when the number exists more than once.
*Deleted from the server* stays a small chip, because it is a state and not a description. Grey rows say why
in the same voice, and say more than they did: **not here yet · (AS) Asura Scans** (the group that has it),
**waiting for Asura Scans · 2 days left** — with the preferred group named and the patience counted down
from the oldest copy a group you have not blocked posted (a blocked group's older copy never shortens the
wait: it was never a candidate, and counting from it would read *0 days left* on a row the sweep still
held), where v0.32.0 said *Waiting for a preferred group* and left both to the imagination; *waiting for a
preferred group* is kept only for a hold whose group the server cannot name — **failed 3 times** in amber,
and **only a blocked group has it · Junk Group**. The countdown is judged with today's rules against a hold
decided at the last check, so after a patience change it can read *0 days left* on a row that stays held
until the next sweep; the sheet's *checked {ago}* is the caveat. The *{n} versions* pill and the inline
version list are gone; a grey row, which nothing happened on before, now opens the chapter's sheet when
tapped, and a chapter on disk reaches the same sheet from its ⋯ menu.

That sheet is titled with the chapter (*Ch. 12*, and its title when it has a real one) and lists every copy
the last check saw: avatar and group, language, *{n} pages*, release date, the source with its favicon, and
one state chip — *on server* for the copy the file came from, *server's pick* for the one the rules would take,
*blocked group*. On a grey row each copy has **Fetch**, for anyone who may download, and it takes exactly
that copy — a blocked copy included, because you pointed at it with the label in front of you, as *Fetch
this* did. On a chapter already here it is **Replace…**, for admins, on files Uchiyomi downloaded itself,
disabled on the copy already on disk: the sheet closes, *Replace with this version?* asks, and **Replace**
does what *Fetch again* does with the copy named. A chapter that failed shows admins *Last error: {reason}* at
the top — the hover title that a phone could never reach. A book row's ⋯ menu has **Versions** to open the
same sheet.

The chapter header is four plain chips on one row, at phone width too: **Mark all read · Newest · Filter ·
Select**. **Filter** carries a small numeral for how many filters are on and opens **Filter chapters**: under
*Translated by*, *All* and one chip per group, and a switch, **Show chapters not on the server yet**, which is
the old toggle chip remembered per device. The *All groups* dropdown, the long toggle chip and the line *{n}
on the sources but not here · as of {ago}* are gone — the supply line carries both facts — and *{n} of {m}
chapters match* stays when a group is chosen.

### Fetch is the server, Save offline is this device

The page used *download* for bringing a chapter onto the server and for copying it to your phone —
*Download all* on the one hand, *Downloading {n} chapters* on the other. From now on the server side is
**Fetch**, with the cloud icon (☁), everywhere: *Fetch* and *Fetch again* in the selection bar carry it, as
every grey row already did, the downloads pill reads *Fetching {n} chapters*, a stalled one *Fetch stopped.
Try another source or wait.*, and a finished Discover job *Fetched*. The device side is **Save offline**,
with the arrow (⬇): *Download all* is **Save all offline**, the row's ⬇ is *Save offline* or *Remove from
this device*, and the toasts say *Saving {n} chapters offline…*. The explainer below says the same in one
line. The *Offline* tab keeps its name — it is the device side. Confirmation texts that said *scanlator
rules* now say *translation rules*; the UI says **Translated by** wherever it named a group, and
"scanlation group" survives only in the docs.

### Faces for groups

A group is now a small circle with its initials on a colour that never changes — *AS* for Asura Scans —
in the supply line, the sheets, the chapter rows and the add dialog, so the same group is recognised across
them without being read. The colour is taken from the name the server normalises groups by, so the *Asura
Scans* stamped in a file and the *asura-scans* a source lists get one circle, not two. Beside each group in
the sources sheet and the add dialog is a strip of twelve squares, one per week, filled where the group
released, and a dot: green for a group still going, amber for one the cadence rule calls quiet, grey for the
same silence on a series that is completed or ended — quiet is a warning on a running title and a plain fact
on a finished one — and grey again for a group with no dated release. The strip is drawn only when at least
one of the twelve weeks has something in it; a group with nothing that recent gets a sentence instead —
*quiet — no release in {n} days* when the cadence rule calls it quiet, in amber on a running title and grey
on a finished one, otherwise *last release {ago}* — so a finished series is not a wall of empty squares
with warning dots. Twelve silent weeks is longer than the quiet threshold for a daily or weekly group, so the
quiet sentence is the usual one; *last release {ago}* is what a monthly or irregular group reads until its
own three intervals have passed. *ships weekly · last release 5d ago* is still there, as the strip's hover
title and its name for a screen reader. Sources get their
favicons the same way: in the supply line, the sheets, the chapter sheet, the corner of a Discover card and
the add dialog.

### Older chapters, one tap

The first half of TIGamingTV's follow-up on [#40](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/40). The
chapters below a *Latest N* floor used to fold into one sentence pointing at *Find missing chapters*. The line
is still one line — *Ch. 7–301 · 295 older chapters not here yet* — but **Show** expands it into real grey
rows, each with the ☁ and the chapter sheet like any other, folded past fifty by the same *Show all* as the
rest, and **Fetch all {n}** on the line takes the whole run for anyone who may download. A run longer than
300 goes to the server in batches of 300, one after another: the server runs one fetch job per series at a
time and answers *busy* to a second, so the page waits for each batch's job to finish before it sends the
next, under one toast for the whole run — *Fetching {n} chapters…* — and stops at the first batch that
fails, with its message. *Find missing chapters* under the cover is unchanged.

### Nothing yet

The second half. The add dialog's chapter choice, now labelled **Chapters to fetch now**, ends with
**Nothing yet — pick chapters later**: the series lands with no chapters, its listing written, its cover
fetched, and a chapter floor set just above the newest number the source lists, so auto-update follows new
releases only and every chapter that existed at the time of the add sits under the expandable line above —
*Show* and *Fetch all* are how to take them when you want them. The helper says as much: *Nothing is fetched
now. New chapters arrive with auto-update; older ones can be fetched from the series page.* A title the source
lists no chapters for at all can be added the same way (it is the default there, and the only choice); with
nothing to put a floor above, it gets none, and every chapter that appears is fetched. On such a series the
primary button reads *Nothing to read yet*, *Save all offline* is hidden, the supply line says *{n} chapters
listed · none fetched yet*, and the older-chapters run starts open, since it is the page's only content. The
add counts as the series' first check, because it has just asked the source: the line reads *{n} chapters
listed · none fetched yet* the moment the page opens, and the *Sources* row in the sheet carries the count
and the time of that check, rather than *not checked yet* until the next sweep comes round. Adding a title
this way that you had removed from the library earlier puts the same series back — the same row, with
everyone's history on it — as re-adding one with chapters always has. The dialog's last step says *Added —
new chapters will be fetched as they come out* rather than *Already in your library*. The floor is a
convention worth stating: it sits a thousandth above the newest listed number, so a chapter numbered between
the two would count as older — no real numbering does that.

### Discover breathes

The wall of source chips under Newest/Popular — up to twelve, with a note line or two under them — is one
chip: three stacked favicons, **All sources**, *{n} sources*, and *{n} with issues* in amber when any source
is rate-limited or blocked. The number is every source that can answer the listing you are on — Newest, or
Popular for the sources that rank one — and is not disabled, not the handful the wall is asking at this
moment; the sheet says which is which. It opens a **Sources** sheet with one row per source — favicon,
name, a health dot, the server's note (or *Could not be reached right now.* when it gave none) and *back in
~{n} min* — with *Asking {n} of {m} · tap a source to browse it alone* in its footer, and tapping a row
browses that source alone; the chip then shows its favicon and name with an × to go back to all of them.
A source in a cooldown browsed alone says so in place of the wall — its reason and *back in ~{n} min*, in
amber — rather than the *Nothing new from these sources right now* that would have been a lie about it.
The card corners that spelled the source's
name now show its favicon; a title several sources carry says *{n} sources* instead of a bare number. In
the add dialog, step one lists sources with their favicons and marks the first *most used* (it was
*preferred*, which sounded like a setting); step two opens with *From [favicon] MangaDex · Change*, the
groups sit under **Translated by** with avatars and activity strips, and the progress step reads *Fetching
{n} chapters*.

### What these words mean

Nobody had ever said, inside the app, what a source, an extension or a translation group is. A small (i)
now does, in five lines: **Source** (a website Uchiyomi reads manga from: MangaDex, or a site an admin
added), **Extension** (a plug-in from the Mihon catalogue that teaches Uchiyomi one site; one extension can
add several sources, one per language), **Site by URL** (a site added by pasting its address, read with the
built-in reader, so it cannot say which group translated a chapter), **Translated by** (the fan group that
translated a chapter; a chapter often has several versions, the server keeps one, taking a preferred group
first, never a blocked one, and waiting for a preferred group for the patience you set) and **Fetch vs Save
offline** (☁ brings a chapter onto the server for everyone, ⬇ copies it to this device). The (i) sits
wherever the words are used: in the header of the *Sources & translations* sheet, in Discover's *Sources*
sheet, and beside *Add a site* on **Admin → Providers**.

### Also

- Markdown is stripped from descriptions: a MangaDex summary no longer reads `**Year:** 1997 ---` — on
  Discover's add dialog, on the series that add creates, and, at read time, on every series already in the
  library that was written before this release, so nothing needs re-adding.
- Members with no sources were told *Add one in Admin → Providers*, a console they cannot open; they now
  read *No sources are set up yet. Ask whoever runs this server.*
- Discover's heading said *Newest from your sources* whichever toggle was on; it says *Popular on your
  sources* when that is what it is showing.
- *Popular* on Discover was the one toggle with no translation; it has one now, as do *Updated {ago}*,
  *Continue*, *Start reading*, *Oldest* and the chapter row's menu items, which had been English in every
  language.
- The series page no longer asks the server for the source list on behalf of members who may not download;
  it was a 403 on every visit that nothing needed.

For the API, all of it additive: `GroupStat` gains `weeks`, twelve booleans oldest first, on
`GET /api/series/:id/groups`, the admin scanlators route and `GET /api/sources/detail`; a held `Ghost` in
`GET /api/series/:id/listing` carries `waitingFor` and `waitDaysLeft`; `POST /api/sources/add` accepts
`chapterFrom: "none"` and answers `nothing: true` for it; `summary` on `/api/sources/detail` and
`GET /api/series/:id` is plain text, HTML and markdown removed. No route was added or removed, and the
Mihon extension is unaffected.

## v0.33.0 — 2026-09-14

The rest of [#40](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/40). v0.32.0 answered it as it had been read:
a per-source screen, so the ghost rows, the selection bar and the picker of known groups. TIGamingTV then
made the ask plain with a MangaDot screenshot, and it was never about a source — it was about a *series*:
every version of a chapter, side by side, with who released it, in what language, how many pages and when;
and a panel that says who scanlates this title and how they are doing. That is what this release is, and
the extension carries the group along so a reader app can do the same.

### Who scanlates this

The series page now opens with a **Who scanlates this** card, below the description and above the chapter
list: one row per group, with how many chapters it has released, the range it covers (*Ch. 12–84*), how
many of its releases are on this server, when it last released, and a cadence line — *ships daily*, *ships
weekly*, *ships monthly*, *releases irregularly* — or the thing the card exists to say, *quiet — no release
in 34 days*. The cadence is the median gap between the group's last ten releases — uploads less than half
a day apart are one release, so a ten-chapter batch counts once, whatever side of midnight it lands — a day and a half
or less is daily, up to nine days weekly, up to forty monthly, anything longer irregular; *quiet* is a
group that has been silent for three of its own intervals or two weeks, whichever is longer (or forty-five
days for a group with no measurable interval). With fewer than two dated releases there is no rhythm
label, only *last release {ago}* — or *quiet* after forty-five days. **Show
chapters** lists the group's numbers as chips — solid for chapters on this server, dimmed for ones it has
not got — and tapping one scrolls to the row.

**Prefer** and **Block** live here now. They were in *Edit details* since v0.31.0, a panel most readers
never open, and the group they applied to was a line in a list with a count beside it; they now sit on the
row of the group whose releases you are looking at, with the ranking arrows and the patience setting, and
*Edit details* keeps a one-line pointer. The rules have not changed, only the address. Members see the
card too — the stats are for everyone — and only admins get the buttons (`GET /api/series/:id/groups`;
`GET /api/admin/series/:id/scanlators` answers with the same stats plus the buttons' state).

### Every version, and Fetch this

The listing the sweep keeps (`series_listing`) held one copy per chapter number — the one the scanlator
rules chose — and the names of the other groups. It now keeps **every copy**: group, language, page count,
release date and source, with the chosen one first. A chapter row whose number exists more than once
shows a **{n} versions** pill; tapping it opens the versions inline, one line each, marked *on this server*,
*chosen* or *blocked* (`GET /api/series/:id/versions`). Beside each is **Fetch this**: on a grey row it
downloads exactly that copy; on a chapter already here — admins only, after *Replace with this version?* —
it is the *Fetch again* of v0.32.0 with the copy named, so a chapter can be swapped for the other group's
version without losing where anyone was in it (`POST /api/sources/fetch` and `…/chapters/refetch` take
`picks`).

A pick is an explicit choice of one copy, and it is treated as one: unlike a plain *Fetch*, which follows
the automatic rules and refuses a blocked group, *Fetch this* on a copy marked *blocked* takes it — you
pointed at it, with the label in front of you. It still ignores patience and resets the retry cap, as every
manual fetch does, and it still needs the copy to be in the last check's listing; a copy the listing does
not know is refused as *not listed*, never guessed at.

And a grey row no longer needs *Select* to be fetched on its own: for anyone who may download, each one
ends in a cloud icon that fetches that chapter — asked for on #40 with a Tachimanga screenshot, where the
fetch button sits on the row — the same request the bar's *Fetch* makes, minus the selection.

### Filter the chapter list by group

An **All groups** chip beside *Oldest/Newest* narrows the chapter list to one group — on-disk chapters by
the group written on them, grey rows by the groups that released them — and a line says *{n} of {m}
chapters match*. Select mode acts on the filtered set, so "everything Fuuscans released that is not here"
is a filter, *Select*, *Fetch*.

### On Discover, before you add

The add dialog already fetched a title's chapter list to count it; the count now has company. Under it, a
compact *Who scanlates this* — the five busiest groups with releases and cadence — and *{n} chapters have
more than one version*, so which group carries a title, whether it is still moving, and whether the
scanlator rules will have anything to choose between are all known before the first chapter is downloaded.
Nothing extra is asked of the source: the list was already in hand (`GET /api/sources/detail` gains
`groups` and `versions`).

### The extension carries the group

Extension **1.6.4** sets the scanlation group on each chapter it hands Mihon or Tachimanga — the field
Uchiyomi has recorded since v0.31.0 and the extension had been dropping — so those apps' own *filter by
group* and *sort by group* work on an Uchiyomi library exactly as they do on MangaDex.

### Extensions with many languages take one card

**Admin → Providers** listed a multi-language extension as one card per language, enabled or not — 3Hentai
alone was twenty-nine boxes, and the extensions you actually use were somewhere below them. An extension
now folds into one card: its name, *{n} languages*, how many are on, the worst health among them, and a ▾
that opens a compact row per language with its own status, series count and Enable/Disable. The header
counts *{n} sources in {m} providers*. An extension with one source, the built-in engines and sites added
by URL are the plain cards they were (the source list carries `extension: { pkgName, name }` for `sw:`
entries).

### The limits, stated

Groups exist where the source names them: MangaDex and the extensions that carry the information. The
built-in engines and sites added by URL name none, so on those series the card is empty and the chapter
list has no versions to show. Cadence is measured from the dates the source shows, and a source that shows
none gives *unknown* rather than a guess. Every number on the card is as old as the last check — the
nightly sweep or *Check now* — and the card says so, like the grey rows do; a title added from Discover
gets its listing written by the add itself, so the card is there before the first sweep. On a series never
checked whose files name no group, members see no card and admins an empty one, so patience stays settable. And a version list is the sources' word, not a promise: a copy that vanished upstream since
the last check is refused at fetch time, not silently swapped for another.

## v0.32.0 — 2026-09-14

What one reader asked for after v0.31.0 shipped ([#40](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/40):
the scanlator rules and the second source were real but invisible from the series page), and the first
outside contribution to the code — [PR #41](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/41) by TIGamingTV,
a job that deletes chapters once everyone has read them — taken through the same pipeline as everything
else and fixed where it needed fixing before it could be trusted with a `rm`.

### Chapters the sources have that you don't

Until now the series page listed what was on disk and nothing else. "3 behind" was a number with nothing
under it; a chapter being held for a preferred group looked exactly like one the source had never released;
a chapter that had failed three times and been given up on looked like nothing at all. The page now also
shows, greyed, every chapter the followed sources list that this server does not hold, and says why: *not
downloaded yet*, *waiting for a preferred group*, *failed 3 times*, *only blocked groups released it*, or
below the "Latest N" floor — those last ones collapse into a single line that leads to *Find missing
chapters*, which is where they were always meant to be taken from. Nothing is asked of a source when the
page opens: the sweep and *Check now* now keep a per-series listing (`series_listing`) of every number a
source offers and which copy the scanlator rules chose, and the page reads that. So a listing is exactly as
old as the last check, and the page says so ("as of 2 hours ago"). Members see the grey rows too; only
people who may download can act on them.

Acting on them is the other half. **Select**, beside *Mark all read*, turns the chapter list into a pick
list, and the bar at the bottom does the same job the Library's does: mark read or unread, save offline,
and **Fetch** — download the ghosts you picked, now. A manual fetch has the same permission as *Find
missing chapters* and takes the listing as its authorisation (a number the last check did not see is
refused, not guessed at). It deliberately ignores two of the automatic rules: *patience* — you are the one
asking, so the best copy on offer is taken rather than waited on — and the retry cap, which it resets. It
never ignores the *blocklist*: a chapter only blocked groups released is shown so you know it exists, and
unblocking the group is the way to have it.

For admins the bar carries two more. **Delete from server** removes the file and nothing else: the chapter
row stays, marked *Deleted from the server*, everyone's progress stays, the counts stay, and the series
cover moves to the lowest chapter that still has a file — the same tombstone the cleanup below leaves. It
only ever touches a file Uchiyomi downloaded itself, and never one a reader has bookmarked; a chapter in a
library you assembled, or with a bookmark on it, is skipped and the toast says how many and why — and a
delete that deleted nothing is reported as the failure it is, not as *0 deleted*. **Fetch again** is the replace that v0.31.0 refused to do on its own: the file is set
aside, the copy the scanlator rules choose *now* is downloaded onto the same row — so a chapter you took
before ranking a group can be swapped for that group's copy without losing where anyone was in it — and the
old file is put back if the download fails. A different group's copy may have a different page count.

### Pick from known groups

A series' *Edit details* panel has listed its own groups since v0.31.0, but the server defaults under
**Admin → Settings → Scanlators** — the blocklist that applies to every series, the ranking a series
without one falls back to — were bare text fields, and a group name has to match exactly. They now offer,
under the field, the group names actually seen across the library — on disk and in the sources' listings,
busiest first, filtered as you type — as chips to press, so there is nothing to spell from memory
(`GET /api/admin/scanlators`).

### Delete chapters after they are read

From [PR #41](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/41) by TIGamingTV, the first code contribution,
and good work: an opt-in hourly job that deletes the file of a chapter once **everyone who started it has
finished**, N days after the last of them did (30 by default; 0 means the next run). Off by default, and
switching it on under **Admin → Settings → Delete read chapters** asks you to confirm with the number of
chapters the first run would take in front of you. It only touches Uchiyomi's own downloads folder, never a
library you assembled; it leaves alone anything one reader is partway through, anything nobody has opened,
anything bookmarked (a bookmark points at a page inside the file), and the chapter a series draws its cover
from. What it leaves behind is a *tombstone*: the chapter row stays, marked deleted, so reading history
survives, no count changes, nothing is pushed to AniList, and the updater — whose idea of "have" is the
rows — does not fetch the chapter back the same night. `CLEANUP_MAX_PER_RUN` (500) caps one run, as a blast
radius rather than a speed limit. **Admin → Tasks → Delete read chapters** shows the last run and what it
freed.

What was fixed on top before shipping, plainly. The PR's thirteen integration tests had never run: every
one died at its seed, which set the series cover before the chapter existed, so the job's rules were
proven by unit tests of the SQL text alone. Its seventeen strings existed in English only. And the
tombstone was honoured by the series page and the reader but not by the rest of the product: OPDS feeds,
`GET /api/books/:id/next`, *Continue reading*, the offline plan, the download manifest, the fingerprint and
page-hash jobs, the web reader's own next/previous, and the Mihon extension all still handed out a chapter
with no file — every one now skips it (extension 1.6.3 hides them). A chapter fetched again after a prune
would have been deleted at the next hourly run, because everyone's progress on it still said *finished*:
the job now judges by reads of the copy on disk — a chapter is due only when its last reader finished
*after* the current file landed. A tombstone now forgets the page dimensions, fingerprint and page
hashes it had cached, which described bytes that no longer exist. A downloads folder that is not there
when the job runs — a network share not mounted right now, so every chapter it was about to look at is
missing folder and all — stops the run and says so, where the first version would have marked five
hundred chapters an hour as deleted while their files sat safe on the unmounted disk; a single series
whose folder was removed by hand is still marked as gone, and a hidden series is not examined at all. And
a reader who finished a chapter last year and is re-reading it today is left alone: a completed row that
is not at the chapter's end counts as partway through.

### Found on the way

The web reader's next/previous list could walk into a deleted chapter (fixed with the rest of the
tombstone audit above), and the series cover now follows the lowest chapter that still has a file rather
than the lowest number, so a manual delete of chapter 1 does not take the art off the shelf. The reader's
"finished this chapter" ping reported the last page *shown*, which with junk pages hidden is a page or two
short of the file's end; it now reports the chapter's real last page, as the cross-into-the-next-chapter
ping always did — without that, the cleanup above would have read every such chapter as still being read.
The Library's select bar was painted under the phone's bottom navigation, so its chips could not be tapped
below the first row; both select bars now sit above the bar.

### The limits, stated

A listing is as old as the last check; a series never checked has no grey rows at all, and *Check now* is
how to get them. A followed source in a cooldown is not listed on that sweep, so numbers only it carries
drop off the page until the next one. Counts keep tombstones: a chapter nobody read that an admin deletes
stays "unread" until it is fetched again, and *Mark unread* on a live one counts as an unfinished reader,
so the cleanup leaves it alone until it is read again. Blocked ghosts are not fetchable — unblock first.
And the cleanup's first-run count is lower than you might expect on a downloads folder copied without its
modification times: the mtime rule then reads every file as newer than its reads, which fails toward
keeping, and it corrects itself as chapters are read again.

## v0.31.0 — 2026-09-13

Both halves of [#35](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/35): which group's release to keep, and
following a series on more than one source.

### Which scanlation group's release to keep

On MangaDex, and on most extensions, a chapter comes back once per group that released it. Uchiyomi keeps
one file per chapter number, so something had to pick — and until now that something was three adapters
with three different rules, none of which knew what a group was: the extension bridge threw the name away
one line after receiving it, MangaDex was never asked for it, and the pick was whichever copy happened to
be listed first. Nothing in the Mihon family does better; Mihon only excludes groups, because it shows every
duplicate row and leaves the choice to the reader.

The choice is now one rule in one place (`bff/src/lib/releases.ts`), applied wherever a source is listed: a
per-series ranking ("prefer A, then B"), a blocklist ("never C"), and a patience window — how long to wait
for a ranked group before taking the best copy on offer (2 days by default, 0 to take it at once). Server
defaults live under **Admin → Settings → Scanlators**; a series overrides them from *Edit details*. Blocks
accumulate, a series ranking replaces the server's, and patience falls back. A joint release belongs to
every group on it and is blocked only when all of them are. A chapter already on disk is never replaced by
a better-ranked copy that arrives later; the chapter row shows which group it came from, and the group is
written into the file as ComicInfo `<Translator>` — the tag Mihon and Suwayomi write and Komga and Kavita
read. Files downloaded before this release carry no group.

Three things the rule deliberately does not do: wait on a source that names no groups (a scraped site with a
priority list set would otherwise hold every chapter for two days for a group that can never arrive); prefer
an external link — MangaDex's pointer to the publisher's own site — over a copy that can actually be read,
whatever group it carries; and replace anything. The add path applies the server blocklist too, because a
blocked copy taken at add time would be locked in by the never-replace rule.

### Following a series on a second source

A series has always been wired to exactly one source. It can now also follow others: from **Find missing
chapters**, any source whose numbering matches at least 90 % of what you hold can be followed with one
press (admin only, the same gate that keeps the fill from filing another story's chapters under yours).
The sweep then lists every followed source and takes each missing number from the first that has it, the
primary winning ties — so whichever site releases first is the one that supplies the chapter, and a series
whose extension was uninstalled keeps updating from the site it also follows. "N behind" counts across
followed sources, each chapter row says where it came from, and Health lists a dead-primary series that
still has a live follower as reference rather than frozen.

Found on the way and fixed: *Check for new chapters now* downloaded chapters that only appeared in the
library at the next scan; it scans now, and says when chapters are being held for a preferred group rather
than reporting "already up to date".

Guards for every rule above are proven by reintroduction — the one worth naming is that a series whose
primary adapter is gone used to answer "unrouted" before its followers were even read, which three
independent reviewers caught against the Health page's promise.

## v0.30.0 — 2026-09-13

Four things one reader asked for on the day the Mihon extension shipped ([#36](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/36),
[#37](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/37), [#38](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/38)).

### Hide the languages you don't read

Installing an extension switched on every source it ships, in every language — one extension can be thirty
of them — and quietly ate the `SUWAYOMI_MAX_SOURCES` limit (25), with the overflow visible only in the server
log. **Admin → Extensions → Languages** now lists every language your extensions offer, with how many sources
and how many of your series came from them, and hides or shows a whole language in one press. Hidden is a
standing setting: the next extension you install leaves those languages off. One request flips every row in
one statement and reloads the sources once (`POST /api/admin/extensions/sources/bulk`).

Two things came out of the same work. A source you switched off — by hand or by language — no longer turns
the Health page amber; it is listed greyed as "turned off by you", and a series whose source you hid is
reported as "switched off" rather than "no longer installed". And the source limit finally has a face: the
panel and Health both say when enabled sources are not registered because of it.

The panel's layout and the Health observation are from [#39](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/39)
by TIGamingTV; the implementation was reworked so hiding a language is one reload rather than one per source,
and so an install respects it.

### Extension downloads at the speed the engine allows

Pages were fetched one at a time with a quarter-second pause between them. That rule exists because that is
what stopped the 429s on the sites we scrape ourselves — but it was applied identically to extension sources,
where every page request goes to the local engine, which fetches upstream one page at a time because we asked
one at a time. A 120-page chapter through a proxy, serially, with a pause: one to two minutes.

Pacing is now the source's to declare. Extension sources fetch four pages at once with no pause (the engine
enforces each extension's own rate limits, as Mihon would); scraped sites keep the old rule to the
millisecond — the floor is measured from the previous reply as well as the previous start, so a slow site is
still not asked again until the gap after it answers. A 429 still stops the burst, and the retry runs one
page at a time. `SUWAYOMI_PAGE_CONCURRENCY` (1–8, default 4) is the dial, and it is passed through by every
deploy file — a test now reads the settings table in `docs/extensions.md` and checks each of them, because
this knob was documented before it was wired.

### "Latest N" when adding a series

The Add dialog offers *Latest 10/25/50…* next to *First N* — which, to be honest about it, always meant the
**oldest** N, and the API doc said the opposite. A series added as "Latest N" gets a floor: auto-update
fetches new releases instead of spending weeks backfilling chapter 1 onwards. The older chapters are still
one press away — *Find missing chapters* now offers the run below what you hold, from the series' own source
and no other (the fill dialog's rule against extrapolating across sources stands). The floor is written on
every add, so a series deleted and added again as "All" does not keep one from its earlier life.

### One card per title on the Discover wall

Search already folded the same title from several sources into one card with a count badge; the Newest and
Popular wall did not, so a popular title sat there three or four times. It folds now, the same way, with the
providers ordered as the page ranks sources so the dialog's "preferred" is the one it would have asked first.

## v0.29.0 — 2026-09-13

### One token for a third-party client

An API token (Profile → Account) opened `/api/*` and nothing else: pictures were served only to the
browser's cookie or to an OPDS reader's Basic credential. So a client that had just listed a chapter's pages
could not fetch a single one of them without a second secret pasted in. `/img/*` now accepts an API token as
a Bearer too, and a `read`-scoped token is enough — images are reads. Library grants apply exactly as they
do for a session: a token for a member without access to a library gets the same 404 that member would.

The same token could not search the library either: `POST /api/series/search` is a POST only because its
filter tree travels in a body, but the `read` scope gated every non-GET as a write. That one route is now
exempt — keyed on the route, not the URL, so a query string cannot dress a real mutation up as a search.
Everything else a read token could not do, it still cannot.

This is the groundwork for the Uchiyomi extension for Mihon, Tachimanga and Suwayomi
([#33](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/33)), which holds one token and needs it to work for
everything it fetches. The extension itself lives at
[AngeloSha/uchiyomi-extension](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi-extension); the README and
`docs/USAGE.md` point at it.

### "Popular", for a library that belongs to one person

Mihon requires every source to answer a popular listing, and for a personal shelf the word means nothing —
so `POST /api/series/search` gained `sort: "favorites,desc"`: your starred series first, then whatever you
are furthest behind on. It is per user, and there is a test that fails if one member's stars ever sort
another member's list.

Found on the way: the existing `unread` sort named a per-user join that only exists for signed-in callers,
so an anonymous request with that sort was a SQL error rather than a listing. Nothing could reach it (the
library requires a session), but it is closed now: without a user, both sorts fall back to title order.

## v0.28.1 — 2026-09-13

### A series folder with a cover in it is still a series

Reported and diagnosed by [@ThomasRunting](https://github.com/ThomasRunting) in
[#34](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/issues/34): a Tranga library — top-level series folders, each
holding its `.cbz` chapters and a thumbnail — scanned to **zero series** in four seconds, with no error
anywhere. They read the scanner and found why: any subfolder containing an image was counted as a chapter,
so every series folder read as a chapter *of the root*; the root therefore "had chapters", and a directory
with chapters is a series that the scanner does not descend into. At the root that pushed nothing and
walked nothing.

Their one-line fix is in. It is not the whole fix, though, because the same test hid three more layouts:
Mihon's local source (`cover.jpg` beside chapter folders), Komga and Kavita (`cover.*` beside archives), and
any of those inside a wrapper folder — where the failure was **worse than zero**, because the wrapper became
a series whose "chapters" were the real series. A folder is now a chapter only if its images are the whole
of its contents; anything holding archives or image-bearing subfolders is a series. Seven layout fixtures
cover it, and each part of the fix has a test that only it holds.

The "run now" buttons in Tasks were not broken — the scan ran, found nothing, and the toast said *Started*,
which from the outside is indistinguishable from a button that does nothing. It now says what the scan
found, and says "nothing found — check the folder layout" when that is the answer.

### The cover proxy's engine exemption no longer follows redirects

The cover proxy trusts one origin — the configured extension engine — and skips the SSRF guard for it. Its
own comment said *"redirects are not followed here"*, and for two releases that was a sentence rather than a
fact: the fetch used the default, which follows. A redirect from the engine to a private address would have
been followed with no guard looking at the hop. It now refuses redirects, proven against a real redirecting
server rather than a mock. Found by re-reading the line CodeQL flagged — the tool could not see the origin
check, but it did make someone look.

Two smaller CodeQL findings fixed on the way: a test that asserted a hostname by substring (the exact
weakness it was asserting against), and a no-op `.replace('/', '/')` in the browser suite.

## v0.28.0 — 2026-09-10

### The server can tell you a new version exists

Until now it could not: the version lived in `package.json` and nothing read it at runtime, so the app did
not know what it was, let alone whether anything newer had been published. **Admin → Health** now has a
Version row, and once a day the server asks GitHub whether a newer release is out.

It is a plain read of a public releases page — the same one you could open in a browser. **Nothing about
your server is sent.** GitHub sees an IP address, as it would for anyone loading a public page, and that is
all. Being a version behind is never treated as a fault and will not turn anything amber; an update notice
that cries wolf is one people learn to ignore.

On by default, with a switch in Settings. Off means no request is made at all, and the row says so rather
than quietly claiming you are up to date. If GitHub cannot be reached, it says that too — "up to date" and
"we could not ask" look identical on a page, and only one of them is a reason to relax.

### And, if you want, it can be counted

Nobody can see how many people self-host this. That is the point of self-hosting, and it also means nobody —
including whoever wrote it — knows whether a release reached twenty people or two hundred.

So there is now an **opt-in** install count, **off by default**, as a separate switch. Turn it on and once a
day your server sends this, and nothing else, to uchiyomi.com:

```json
{ "id": "3f2a…", "month": "2026-09", "version": "0.28.0",
  "arch": "arm64", "layout": "aio", "db": "embedded" }
```

The settings page shows you that exact object before you agree to it — not a description of it, the literal
thing, built by the same code that sends it, so the two cannot drift apart.

- **The id changes every month.** It is a hash of a secret that never leaves your server plus the current
  month. Two pings in one month count as one install; two pings in different months cannot be linked to each
  other — not by us, and not by anyone who obtained the data, because the secret is not in it.
- **No library, no titles, no accounts, no address, no hostname.** A test fails the build if a field is ever
  added to that payload, because a field added quietly is a field you were never shown.
- **The collector stores no IP and no clock time**, only the UTC date, and access logging is off for that
  endpoint so there is no side channel that re-identifies a row. Anything unrecognised in a ping is dropped
  rather than stored. Months older than a year are deleted.
- **Turning it off destroys the secret** and asks the collector to forget the current month. Turning it back
  on later makes a new id — it cannot resume the old one, which is the honest behaviour even though it means
  a returning install looks like a new one.
- `GET https://uchiyomi.com/api/hello` shows the running totals, so you can see what your ping became.

The two switches are deliberately separate and point at different servers. If the update check went to a
server this project runs, that server could count installs from its access log whether or not anyone
consented, and "updates on, counting off" would be a setting that did nothing. Keeping them apart is what
makes the off position real, and there is a test that fails if they ever converge.

`UCHIYOMI_PING_URL` repoints the count at your own collector, or disables it outright if set empty.

## v0.27.0 — 2026-09-09

### One Library, and its filters finally organised

Browse was a second Library. `/browse?genre=Horror` ran the same search over the same collection and drew it
in the same grid as `/library?genres=Horror` — the only thing it had of its own was the wall of genre tiles.
So the tab is gone, and the wall's useful half has moved to where you were going to end up anyway.

The Library's own controls had drifted into a pile: three horizontally-scrolling rows of chips, one of them
seven wide, mixing four sort options with a Filters button, an 18+ toggle and a Select toggle — nothing
saying which were sorts and which were filters. Behind the Filters button, the genre list was a flat wall of
**ninety-three unsorted, uncounted, unsearchable words**.

All of it now lives in one panel with labelled sections — **Sort by**, **Library**, **Read state**,
**Status**, **Format**, **Genres**. On a laptop the panel sits down the left of the grid and stays there. On
a phone it opens as a proper sheet: one Filters button instead of a row of seven chips.

What came across from Browse:

- **Genres are counted and ranked**, biggest first, each with a small mosaic of covers from that shelf — the
  part of the old tile wall that made it worth looking at, at a size that suits a list.
- **Formats stay separate from genres.** Manhwa covers 161 of the 2,132 series on the library this was built
  against, so ranked by size it outranks every actual genre while saying nothing about what a book is like.
- **Surprise me**, the random-series button, is now beside the Library title.
- A **search box** over the genres, so ninety-three of them is a list rather than a wall.

Two things fixed on the way past:

- The genre list used to come from an endpoint that returns genres exactly as they are spelled, while the
  filter matches them case-insensitively. That is 100 chips for 93 genres: "Martial arts" and "Martial Arts"
  appeared as two, and either one returned the same series. They are now one.
- Picking a library used to filter the grid while the Filters badge said nothing was filtered, because the
  library tabs were counted as navigation rather than as a filter. Now everything that narrows the shelf
  counts, and `Clear all` clears all of it.

The publication statuses — Ongoing, Completed, Hiatus, Cancelled — were being title-cased in code rather
than translated, so they read in English in all eight languages. They are translated now.

### Large displays have been a column short this whole time

Found while measuring the new layout, and older than it. Five cover grids — library, search (twice),
discover and the admin picker — each ended with a step like `min-[1800px]:grid-cols-10`, and **not one of
them had ever applied**. Tailwind emits that kind of breakpoint before its own named ones, so on a 1920px
display the earlier `2xl` rule came later in the stylesheet and won.

Nothing failed, because a grid one step short of its own source code still looks like a grid. Measured in a
browser at 2560px: seven columns of 314px covers where the class list asked for ten.

The extra breakpoints are now declared properly, and a test refuses any responsive step that a later rule
would override. It found the fifth grid on its first run.

### The last of the MangaRead covers

Different fault from v0.26.3, and this one was doubling the listing.

The listing parser reads the same series link out of three different pieces of markup, and one of the three
patterns dropped the trailing slash from the URL while the other two kept it. On any site that writes the
slash — MangaRead does — the check for "have I already seen this series?" never matched. Every series came
back **twice**: once properly, and once more named after its `alt` text and carrying no cover at all.

Measured against a live MangaRead listing: twelve series parsed as twenty-four. Because a source page keeps
the first 24 results, that also means half of what MangaRead offered on Discover was a copy of the other
half. The proper entries came first and the blank ones after, which is why it looked like a few missing
covers rather than a doubled list.

The three passes now agree on the key. The URL a series is *stored* under is untouched, so nothing already
in a library is affected. This also fixes the reverse case, which nobody had reported: a site writing the
slash on its headings but not its thumbnails loses **every** cover rather than half of them.

It hid for so long because every fixture in the test file wrote URLs without a trailing slash — the one
shape that breaks was the one shape the tests never used. It is now asserted in both directions.

## v0.26.3 — 2026-09-09

### The rest of the grey covers, and why they broke on their own

v0.26.2 fixed the covers that came from the extension engine. The ones that remained — some of a source's
covers working and others not, on the same page — were a different fault with a much more ordinary cause.

Sites that load images lazily put a spacer in the `src` attribute and the real picture in `data-src`. The
code that reads a cover out of that markup was written as one regular expression listing both attributes,
which reads as a preference and is not one: which attribute wins is decided by regex mechanics and by the
order the site happened to write them in. Two different spellings of that expression were in use, in
different parts of the code, and they failed on **opposite** attribute orders.

So a cover was right or wrong depending on nothing but markup order — which is the whole answer to why
covers that worked for months stopped without anything changing here: the site reordered its markup, and the
extraction quietly flipped. It is also why only *some* series were affected rather than all of them.

There is now one place that answers "which attribute holds the picture", and it answers by preference:
`data-src`, then the other lazy attributes, then `srcset`, and `src` only as a last resort. Every engine uses
it. The same fault was present in the code that reads **page images**, where it would have served placeholder
pages rather than placeholder covers — nobody had hit it yet.

### A picture repeated on every card is not a cover

When a listing comes back with the same image on three or more different series, that image is a placeholder
and the covers were not parsed. Rather than show one picture twenty times — which is a confident lie — the
cover is dropped, and the fallbacks that already exist take over: the artwork from AniList for a series in
your library, then its first downloaded page, and otherwise the app's own empty tile.

### Sources are now checked for this, not just for whether they answer

The daily source check already fetched a listing and a series page and looked only at whether they returned
anything. It now also compares them: when the two disagree about the same series' cover, one of the two
parsers is wrong, and that is exactly the fault above — visible without waiting for somebody to notice grey
tiles. It also notices one image repeated across a listing, and a listing that has lost its covers entirely.

Reported in Admin → Health, never as a failure: a source whose covers are wrong still fetches and reads
perfectly well, and marking it broken would turn a cosmetic fault into an outage.

### Security

Two Dependabot advisories, both about zip extraction following symlinks, neither with a published fix.
Assessed rather than ignored: one is a test-only dependency that never reaches a running server, and the
other is used here solely to *build* archives — the vulnerable extraction call is never made, and untrusted
archives are read by a different library entirely. A test now enforces that second claim, so if extraction is
ever added, it fails rather than quietly making the assessment untrue.

## v0.26.2 — 2026-09-09

### Discover's grey covers

Whole rails of Discover showed a grey box with a broken-image icon instead of cover art — every result from
an affected source, permanently. The cause is a fix colliding with a design.

v0.21.0 hardened the cover proxy so it could not be pointed at anything on the local network, because the URL
it fetches is supplied by whoever asks. Separately, the extension engine serves every cover through itself,
so an extension source's cover lives at the engine's own address — which is on the local network. The guard
did exactly what it was written to do, to the app's own engine, and the result was served as a grey
placeholder and then cached under the real cover's key with a one-year lifetime.

The proxy now recognises the one address it is configured to talk to and fetches covers from it, exactly as
the extension-icon route already did. That is a single origin, matched whole — not a rule about private
addresses, which would hand back the capability the original fix removed.

Two more things were wrong in the same place, and both outlived the cause:

- **A failure was cached as though it were the picture.** A cover that could not be fetched wrote its grey
  stand-in under the real cover's key, marked immutable for a year, with nothing able to clear it. One bad
  minute on a source's CDN — or a single hiccup from a name server, which the guard cannot tell apart from a
  blocked address — meant a grey tile until the cache overflowed. Placeholders are no longer stored, and
  expire in a minute.
- **The grey already on your screen would have stayed.** Browsers keep those year-long copies by address, so
  the address changed too, and the server-side entries written under the old scheme are now unreachable.

### The Cloudflare solver says when it is behind, and speaks up when it dies

The solver announces its version and the app printed it and compared it to nothing. Admin → Health now says
when a newer release is out. It is advice, never an alarm: if GitHub is unreachable, rate-limited, or returns
something unfamiliar, the app has no opinion rather than a problem — a health page that can fail because a
third party is having an afternoon is worse than no version check at all.

The bigger gap was that the solver's health was only ever examined when somebody opened the Health tab. A
solver that died at two in the morning stayed dead until it was noticed, while every Cloudflare-protected
source failed and blamed itself — the exact confusion that check exists to clear up. It now runs hourly and
notifies on a change, in both directions, so a recovery is reported too and a long outage does not become
hourly noise.

## v0.26.1 — 2026-09-08

### The background jobs keep up now

Fingerprinting ran **once**, five minutes after the server started, and never again. Nothing else asked for
it either — not a library scan, not the updater sweep, not adding a series from Discover — so every chapter
downloaded after that single pass went unprocessed until the container happened to restart. A server that
simply stays up was the worst case, which is exactly backwards.

The effect was invisible because it looks like nothing: the reader treats an un-fingerprinted page as an
ordinary page, so the feature just quietly stopped applying to anything new. Measured on a real library the
day it shipped: 22 chapters, all added after that morning's boot, still untouched hours later, with 50 to 80
more arriving daily.

Both backfills now re-check every six hours, re-arming after each pass — including a pass that failed, since
a job that stops rescheduling because one batch went wrong is the same bug wearing a different hat. The long
first delay stays: page fingerprinting decodes every page in the library and should not compete with a server
that has just booted.

The same fault was in the older chapter-fingerprint job, which feeds folder rematch. Fixed alongside.

### Marking a page by hand no longer switches the feature off for that chapter

Marking a page as repeated wrote a row that made the chapter look already-processed, so it was dropped from
the queue for good — its other pages were never fingerprinted and the automatic rule never ran there again.
Marking one advert turned detection off for the whole chapter, and it was most likely on a **new** series,
where the backlog is exactly the chapters being opened.

A chapter is now recorded as looked-at only when it has actually been looked at.

### Admin → Tasks shows the backlog

The number of chapters still waiting was calculated, sent to the browser and then discarded, so a job that had
quietly stopped picking up work looked identical to one with nothing left to do. Each task now shows how many
items are outstanding, and the schedule reads honestly instead of claiming the job runs once.

## v0.26.0 — 2026-09-08

### A repeated page folds down instead of disappearing

v0.25.0 removed the pages that are not the story — the credit page, the advert — from the chapter you were
reading. That was the wrong shape, and reading with it for a day made the reason plain: a chapter was quietly
shorter than it really was, a floating chip announced the fact at every chapter start whether you cared or
not, and there was no way to see what was going to be removed before it went.

Now the page stays exactly where it is, drawn as a thin band of itself with a label. You scroll past it in an
instant, or tap it to open it in place and tap **collapse** to fold it away again. The band is a slice of the
real page, so you can see it is the credit page rather than take our word for it — which is the part that was
missing. The floating chip is gone: the notice sits where the page is, which is both harder to miss and
impossible to mistake for a comment about something else.

**Repeated pages** in reader settings now offers *Show all*, *Collapse* (the default) and *Hide*. *Hide* is
the old behaviour for anyone who wants the page gone outright, chip and all. Reading page-by-page rather than
scrolling, *Collapse* still removes — a slide is one whole page wide, so there is no room for a band, and in
that mode an unwanted page costs a swipe rather than a scroll anyway.

### Four bugs that removal had been causing

Putting the page back in the list the reader counts with fixed a set of failures that all had the same root:
while pages were being removed, a position in the chapter and a page number were two different things, and
several places assumed they were the same.

- **Resume and saved Moments landed late.** Opening a Moment saved on page 3 took you to page 4 — one page
  further on for every repeated page earlier in the chapter. Silently, because arriving a page on is
  indistinguishable from having read that far.
- **The chapter divider vanished** when a chapter opened on a credit page, taking the "Up Next" heading with
  it — and because the same marker keeps a chapter's first page unpaired, every double-page spread in that
  chapter was shifted by one.
- **Tapping a dimmed tile in the page grid** scrolled to the top of the entire library instead of to the page
  you tapped.
- **A chapter that was entirely furniture disappeared**, and continuous reading walked from the chapter
  before it to the chapter after with nothing in between.

The reading flow is now built in one place, `web/lib/readerFlow.ts`, where it can be tested — which is why
these were reachable at all. Each has a test that fails when the old behaviour is put back.

## v0.25.2 — 2026-09-08

### Blank slices were being skipped as if they were the same page

The fingerprint asks, sixty-four times, whether a pixel is brighter than the one to its **right**. So the only
variation it can see is variation across a row. The guard meant to refuse featureless pages measured something
subtly different — the brightest and darkest pixel anywhere in the page.

Those come apart on exactly the kind of page a long-strip webtoon is full of. A slice that fades from black at
the top to white at the bottom has the widest possible range, 255, and sails through a guard asking for 8 — while
every left-to-right comparison on it is a tie. All sixty-four answers come back "no", the fingerprint is all
zeros, and *every* such slice in the library carries that same fingerprint. They were being matched to each other
and skipped.

This was not theoretical. On a real 42,000-chapter library the all-zero fingerprint alone was hiding 100 pages,
and in one series 59 of the 166 skipped pages were this. The guard now measures what the fingerprint actually
reads, and a page with no left-to-right variation is refused, as was always intended.

Fixing the guard is not enough by itself, because fingerprints already recorded were written by the old one and
the background job never revisits a chapter it has seen. So the same rule is applied where the matching happens:
a fingerprint in which almost every comparison was a tie is no longer accepted as evidence that two pages are the
same page. That takes effect immediately, without re-reading anything.

Some genuinely repeated near-blank separators stop being skipped as a result. They are blank slices, so this
shows up as a sliver of nothing rather than a missing panel — and fewer skips is the direction this feature is
meant to be wrong in.

## v0.25.1 — 2026-09-08

### The page-hash job could never finish

Found by watching v0.25.0 run against a real library, which is the only place it shows.

The job picks its next batch by asking for chapters that have no page fingerprints yet, and it writes a row
per page. A chapter that yields *no* pages — an unreadable archive, an empty one, a file that has since been
moved — therefore wrote nothing, and so was still "not looked at yet" when the next batch was chosen. Working
chapters get their rows and drop out; broken ones accumulate. The moment they are all that is left, the loop
has nothing to exhaust and spins on them, at full CPU, forever.

One such chapter in a library is enough, which on any library of real size is close to a certainty.

A chapter that produced nothing now records that it was looked at, so it drops out of the queue like any
other. That mark is inert everywhere else: it carries no fingerprint, so it can never match another page, and
it is never offered to the reader as a page to skip.

### A chapter is never mostly skipped

The same first real run turned up the failure this feature is least allowed to have. Across seven thousand
fingerprinted chapters the average chapter had 1.4 pages of furniture and under 6% of all pages were
flagged — but a few hundred chapters wanted to skip a third or more of themselves, and the worst wanted 68
pages out of 88.

Those are duplicate and phantom chapters, where the same file is filed under several chapter numbers. Every
page then genuinely does recur across chapters, so the arithmetic is right and the conclusion is nonsense.
Nothing inside the rule can tell that case apart, so the chapter's own shape is the check: if more than a
third of a chapter is about to be skipped, the automatic decision is thrown away and the chapter reads
exactly as it always did. Fewer skips, which is the direction this feature is always wrong in.

A page you marked by hand is never subject to that cap. It is the one input that is not arithmetic, and the
entire point of it is that it outranks the rule.

## v0.25.0 — 2026-09-08

### The pages that are not the story

Every chapter of a scanlated series opens with the same credit page. Some carry an advert, or a "read the
rest at…" splash. You swipe past them, chapter after chapter, and they are the single most repetitive thing
about reading here. No manga reader does anything about this — the closest thing in any adjacent product is
Jellyfin skipping a TV intro.

Uchiyomi now finds them and skips them, and the way it decides is deliberately dull. A credit page is *the
same image in every chapter of that series*, so a page whose fingerprint turns up in three or more chapters
is furniture. That is arithmetic, not a guess about what a page looks like: story pages are not the same
picture twice. Three chapters and not two, because two chapters sharing a title card is a coincidence, and
two is the commonest state of a part-downloaded series.

It only ever compares chapters within one series, even though the same group's credit page across *different*
series would be stronger evidence still. Flagging across series means a page could be hidden in a book whose
chapters nobody ever compared, and missing a few skips is a far better failure than that.

Nothing is ever hidden without saying so. A skipped page leaves a quiet chip — *skipped 1 repeated page —
show* — that puts it back with one tap, and the page grid still lists every page, dimmed and labelled, so the
chapter you see is never secretly shorter than the chapter you have. You can mark a page as junk by hand, or
rescue one it got wrong; either decision is permanent and outranks the arithmetic in both directions, which
is what makes skipping safe to leave on by default. It is a switch in reader settings if you would rather it
did not. Pages are fingerprinted by a background job, alongside the other library jobs in Admin → Tasks.

One honest limit: a chapter you downloaded *before* its pages were fingerprinted keeps the flags it was saved
with, until you download it again.

### Things this app claimed that were not true

Four of them, found by reading our own documentation against our own code.

Push notifications are listed as a feature; they need a pair of keys that only the developer setup script
ever generated, so on a normal install the button was not missing-with-a-reason, it was simply absent. The
server now generates and keeps those keys on first boot, exactly as it already did for its signing secret.

`docs/CONFIGURATION.md` said `.env.example` was the authoritative list of settings. Twenty-one of twenty-three
were not in it, including the ones most worth touching on a small server — how many series a sweep may check,
the free-space floor, how long a Cloudflare-protected source is allowed. They are all there now, with their
real defaults.

The v0.6.0 changelog announced that renaming a folder no longer loses your series. That code ships switched
off and appeared in no example file. It is documented now, off by default, with its `report` mode explained.

And a badge added yesterday, showing which series you have downloaded, went stale the moment you downloaded
another — the function that refreshes it had no callers. Mine, from the day before.

### Thanks

[@hawwwwwk](https://github.com/hawwwwwk) again, for [#32](https://github.com/AngeloSha/uchiyomi/pull/32):
`docs/INSTALL.md` still described a database container that has not existed since v0.18.0. Second time he has
caught stale install docs.

## v0.24.0 — 2026-09-07

### The app opens on a plane

Launching the installed app in airplane mode showed the sign-in screen, with the chapters you had downloaded
for exactly this sitting on the device, unreachable. Tapping a chapter *inside* an already-running app has
worked since v0.20.0; a cold start never has, and the code said so — the browser tests carried a note calling
it out of scope, and v0.20.0's own changelog admitted it.

Two things were being thrown away. The session check could not tell "the server rejected you" from "there is
no server to ask": both came back as a plain no, and a plain no means sign in. And the signed-in account was
remembered only in memory, while every downloaded chapter is filed under whose it is — so even past the
sign-in screen the reader would have found nothing, which is a worse failure, because it reads as though the
downloads are gone.

Now a device that had a session keeps it when the server is simply unreachable, and opens on your Downloads
with a banner naming the account. The reader works exactly as it does in a tunnel today. Everything needing
the server is dimmed rather than hidden, because there is nothing behind it until you reconnect — and the
moment you do, it checks in, clears the banner and sends up whatever you read.

The part that took the most care is the part nobody sees. This is a multi-user app and household devices get
shared, so: signing out ends it immediately — the next offline launch asks for a password and lists nothing,
though the files stay on disk and become readable again when that account signs back in. If the server ever
answers that the session is gone, the device signs itself out. The grace expires exactly when the login
itself would have, which the server now tells the app rather than the app assuming. And nothing new is
stored that could serve as a credential: the record says who you were, not how to prove it.

Right-to-left manga also read its double-page spreads in the wrong order offline. The downloaded chapter had
carried the reading direction all along; the reader threw it away and left a comment saying the information
was not available, one field from where it was.

### A README the size of its category

504 lines and 4,797 words, against a median of 132 and 743 across Komga, Kavita, Mihon, Stump, Suwayomi and
Audiobookshelf. The install section alone was longer than five of those six READMEs in their entirety, and
44 lines of it warned about upgrade problems from v0.9.0 and earlier — fourteen releases ago, and already
written down in this file.

It is 141 lines now. Almost nothing was deleted: the platform-by-platform install moved to `docs/INSTALL.md`,
the environment variables to `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`, and the comparison against other readers to
`docs/COMPARISON.md`, where a table making dated claims about five moving projects is less likely to be the
second thing a visitor reads.

## v0.23.0 — 2026-09-07

### Three gradients start rendering what they were written to render

Tailwind v3's opacity scale is multiples of five. `via-ink-950/88`, `to-ink-950/62` and
`via-ink-950/72` are not, so all three matched nothing and were dropped without a warning — the sign-in
screen, the profile header and Wrapped have always drawn a lighter scrim than their code asked for. Tailwind
v4 accepts any integer and would have started honouring them, which on the sign-in screen turns the cover
collage to mud. They are removed rather than adopted: a dependency upgrade is not the moment to restyle a
screen, and making it darker is a decision someone should make on purpose. It is the same shape as the
fog-200 bug this project already keeps a test for — a value that simply produces nothing.

### Tailwind 4

The config file is gone; the theme is an `@theme` block in the stylesheet. Everything carried over, and the
parts that could not be translated were rebuilt: the accent colour, which is themeable at runtime and had no
v4 equivalent for its opacity placeholder; the font variables, which would have become self-referential and
dropped the app to the browser's default typeface; and the placeholder colour, which v4 stopped providing, so
every empty input on this black background would have read as filled. Four utilities changed meaning rather
than name and were rewritten to keep what they meant.

Two visible changes are kept on purpose. Hover styles no longer apply on touch devices, which is what a
phone should do — no more state stuck on a card after a tap. And the wrapper the language switcher uses is
finally invisible to layout; the folder it lives in was never scanned before.

### An empty digest fails the build instead of half-publishing

The release pipeline recorded whatever digest the build step produced, and that action only sets one when
there is image metadata. An empty value went into the artifact the merge job trusts, and the merge matrix
does not stop on a failed sibling — the exact route to a version tag over one architecture instead of two,
which has happened twice. It now fails the build leg. The two publishing actions moved a major version each
at the same time, checked against their source rather than their release notes.

### Smaller things that were already built

A saved page can be un-saved from Moments, which is where you go to look at saved pages; the API for it had
existed since the first commit with no button anywhere. Wrapped draws the weekday breakdown it was already
computing — it knew your busiest day and never showed the week behind it. And the README mentions Moments
and the Reading Studio, which shipped three versions ago without ever being written down.

## v0.22.0 — 2026-09-07

### Next 16 and TypeScript 7, which had to arrive together

TypeScript 7 is the compiler rewritten in Go, and it removes options rather than deprecating them:
`baseUrl` is gone, and so is the classic `node10` module resolution that `"moduleResolution": "Node"`
selected. The backend now says `node16` for both `module` and `moduleResolution`, which still emits
CommonJS -- the shipped `dist/` has the same shape it always had -- and only changes which algorithm finds
a package.

The frontend could not take TypeScript 7 on its own. On Next 15 the compiler resolved `@/*` perfectly well
and the bundler then could not, failing every import of `@/lib/*`; Next 16 resolves it. So the two upgrades
were never separable, and both workspaces moved at once rather than leaving one on a compiler the other
cannot build with.

Offline reading was the thing worth checking, because Next 16 changed how a route is prefetched: Next 15
fetched one payload per route, and 16 fetches a tree and a page segment, with the route's own query string
attached. With the network cut entirely, a downloaded chapter still opens, still decodes its pages out of
IndexedDB, still has both chapter arrows live, and still never falls through to the sign-in page or shows a
raw payload as text.

### A dependency round

undici 6 to 8 and `@node-rs/argon2` 1.8.3 to 2.2.0 on the backend, plus three GitHub Actions. argon2 is a
native module and a password hash is not a thing to be casual about, so the check that mattered was not
that it builds: a hash generated by 1.8.3 was verified under 2.2.0 on both musl and glibc, with the wrong
password still refused on both. Nobody has to change their password.

### The browser suite names what failed

A console error used to be reported with the page it happened on and nothing else, while the failing
resource's URL sat unused in the same event -- which is a bad position to debug from, and was exactly the
position Next 16 left us in. It now prints the resource, and when a run is already red it prints the type of
every request that failed. Requests that fail while the suite is deliberately holding the browser offline
are listed but no longer counted as faults: cutting the network and then reporting that a network request
failed was the harness marking its own test setup as a defect.

## v0.21.0 — 2026-09-07

### The cover proxy stops fetching whatever it is told to

`/img/sources/cover` took a URL and fetched it. It checked the scheme and nothing else, and any signed-in
account — or anything holding an OPDS token — could point it at the server's own network: the database, the
extension engine, the solver, the LAN, a cloud metadata endpoint. It was not even blind about it, because a
failure handed back the upstream status code, which turns the route into a working port scanner, and
anything the image pipeline could decode came back as a picture.

It now refuses anything that is not a public address, resolves the hostname before trusting it, re-checks
every redirect hop rather than letting one bounce it somewhere private, and answers a flat 502 instead of
reporting what it found. A blocked URL is served the same placeholder as any other unusable cover, so there
is no difference to measure.

Two-factor recovery codes were 40 bits, stored unsalted; each one bypasses 2FA on its own. They are 80 bits
now. Image authorisation moved to cover the whole `/img/` prefix, because it lived inside one plugin and any
future plugin serving image bytes would silently have had none. And the HTML stripping that cleans scraped
titles now runs to a fixed point, so a tag cannot survive by being split in half.

### Titles that are not in English can be added again

MangaDex asked only for English chapters, so a series scanlated solely into Spanish or Portuguese reported
zero chapters and could not be added at all — indistinguishable from a dead series. English is still
preferred; when there is none, it now falls back through a fixed language order, one language at a time, so
the chapter list stays coherent rather than mixing languages arbitrarily.

### Node 24, and a dependency sweep

The runtime moves to Node 24 LTS across all three images, CI, and both workspaces at once. Node 26 was
offered but does not become LTS until late October, and shipping a self-hosted product on a Current release
is the wrong trade. zod 4, framer-motion 13, sharp 0.35.4, nginx 1.31 and five GitHub Actions majors all
landed with them.

### Unraid instructions that work

Adding a template repository URL has not worked since Unraid 6.10 removed the field, and the file behind it
has not been read at all since 7.3 — so the documented steps sent people to a box that no longer exists.
The template file now gets copied onto the server instead, which is what Unraid actually reads. Found by
[@hawwwwwk](https://github.com/hawwwwwk).

### Also

`:latest` is now gated on the tag not being a prerelease. It was gated on every image publishing
successfully, but nothing stopped a release candidate from claiming it.

## v0.20.0 — 2026-09-06

### Moments: the pages you saved, as the pages you saved

The bookmark star in the reader has always written to an API that keeps the series, chapter, page and a note
for up to five hundred saved pages, and nothing anywhere rendered that list. You could save a page and never
find it again. `/moments` shows each one as the actual panel, grouped by series, and a note can finally be
attached to a page or to a series. There are four ways in — the top bar, your profile, the series page and
the command palette — and deliberately not a seventh item in the bottom nav, which at 390px would leave
55px per item for German and Russian to clip.

A complete notes API had been sitting unused since the first commit: four routes, a table, an index and a
foreign key, with no frontend reference anywhere. Giving it a screen is what revealed that two of those
routes had no visibility check at all — see below.

### The unread badge counts what is unread

Every cover badge in the app showed the total number of chapters in the series and never moved, however much
you had read. The per-user figure was being computed correctly the whole time and thrown away. Fixed on the
server rather than in the card, because `booksUnreadCount` is a Komga-shaped field that OPDS clients read
too. Extracting that logic also closed a gap nobody had noticed: your favourites rail and the contents of a
collection were returning series with no per-user state at all.

### A reader that pairs, retries and lets you move

A landscape double-page spread — already two pages wide — was pinned beside a portrait page and squeezed to
half width, and because it filled one slot instead of two, every pair after it in the chapter was off by one.
Wide pages, and the page before them, now get a slide of their own.

Reader pages were plain images with no error handling, so a single failed request left a broken glyph until
you reloaded the whole chapter; they now retry once and then offer a button. The chapter list was a dropdown
marked desktop-only, which meant that on a phone the only way through a series was one chapter at a time —
it is a sheet at every width now, and it opens where you already are. The page counter opens a thumbnail
grid of the chapter.

### The Reading Studio, and a Wrapped you can look back through

The profile's Reading tab held four settings cards and no reading. It now has a calendar heatmap, a pace
line and a weekday breakdown, over 90, 180 or 365 days. `/wrapped` gained a year picker: it had always
accepted `?year=`, and both callers hardcoded the current one, so every past year was computed on request
and unreachable.

`/api/wrapped` was bucketing years in the database's timezone and months and weekdays in the server's, while
`/api/stats` next door used UTC. The two endpoints disagreed with each other, and a chapter finished on New
Year's Eve counted in the wrong year for every reader west of UTC. Both are UTC now, and the new range
predicate can use the index where the old one scanned every event an account had ever recorded. "Top genres"
also meant "the genres of your top five series", each counted once whether you read three chapters of it or
three hundred; it is twenty series now, weighted by how much you actually read.

### Covers that tint their own card, and how far behind you are

Each card sets one custom property from its cover's dominant colour, and the existing glow and border tokens
read it, so a card lifts off the page in its own artwork's colour and every surface that does not set it is
unchanged. The series page can finally tell you a source has chapters you do not, from a number the updater
has been computing on a schedule for months and showing to nobody. Five rules keep a slow or unreachable
source from ever reading as alarming, and it is never red.

### Offline reading that works offline

Downloaded chapters opened at page one and announced that you had finished the series after every single
one, because both the resume page and the chapter list came from calls that cannot succeed offline. Progress
is now recorded alongside the download, the chapter list falls back to what you actually hold, and an unknown
list is no longer treated as an ending.

Underneath that, tapping a downloaded chapter with no network did not open the reader at all: the service
worker had no rule for the per-route payload Next fetches on every navigation, so the request went to the
network, failed, and the tab ended up showing that payload as raw text. It is cached per route now, and
navigations no longer all overwrite a single cache entry with whichever page was loaded last. A cold start
with no network still asks you to sign in — that needs the session, which needs the network.

### Fixed while we were in there

`GET /api/notes` and `POST /api/notes` had no visibility check of any kind: they answered for, and wrote
against, any series id at all — including one that had been deleted, one in a library your account has no
grant for, and one above your age cap. The listing also joined any book id stored on a note, so a note could
borrow the title of a chapter in a series you cannot see. Both are closed, and the note length cap now
applies on edit as well as on create, where it was previously bypassable by posting a short note and editing
it.

Saving a bookmark could erase a note written on it, because the star sends no note and the write treated
"absent" and "cleared" as the same thing.

## v0.19.0 — 2026-09-04

### Releases that build on the machine they run on

Every arm64 image used to be cross-built under emulation on an amd64 machine, and that broke four of the
last five releases the same way: the native-module builds hung until the timeout or died on an illegal
instruction, and re-running the failed half was the standing fix. Each architecture is now built on a
machine of that architecture and the two are merged into one image afterwards. The version tag exists only
once both halves do, and `latest` moves only once every image has both, so a half-built release cannot
reach anyone through either.

Every published image now carries a signed statement of which workflow built it from which commit, and a
software bill of materials. `gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/angelosha/uchiyomi:v0.19.0 --owner AngeloSha`
checks it.

### Watched dependencies, scanned code

Dependabot watches the two npm trees, the workflow actions and the base images of all three Dockerfiles,
weekly and grouped, so the eighteen-minute test run happens once per ecosystem per week rather than thirty
times. CodeQL scans the TypeScript on every push and weekly; findings land in the repository's Security tab.

### Unraid and Umbrel

An Unraid Community Applications template (`deploy/unraid/uchiyomi.xml`) and an Umbrel app
(`deploy/umbrel/uchiyomi/`), both the one-container layout with the database inside, which is what both
stores expect and what v0.18.0 made possible. Honesty note: the Umbrel manifest is written to Umbrel's
published format and tested for shape, but has not yet been run on umbrelOS itself; its store submission is
a pull request to Umbrel's app repository, and it pins the image by digest, which is filled in once this
release exists.

## v0.18.0 — 2026-09-04

### One container, database included

Leave `DATABASE_URL` unset and the container runs its own Postgres: initialised on first start in the
`uchiyomi_data` volume, listening on a unix socket only -- nothing outside the container can reach it and
there is no password to manage -- and started before the app so the app never races it. That one variable
is the whole switch. Set it, as every install before this release has, and none of it runs; the container
behaves exactly as it did.

`deploy/docker-compose.yml`, the file the install instructions curl, is now that one container plus the
optional solver and extension engine. The layout with a Postgres container beside the app is still shipped
as `deploy/docker-compose.external-db.yml` and is still supported; `docs/MIGRATING.md` has the move in both
directions, which is a dump and a restore over the socket. App stores expect a one-container app, and this
is what makes the Unraid and Umbrel manifests in the next release possible at all.

The container is now a supervisor for exactly two processes and knows which one is the database. On
`docker stop` the app finishes what it is writing and then Postgres stops cleanly (the compose file gives it
a 40 s grace period, because Docker's default ten would kill a checkpoint). If Postgres dies underneath the
app, the app is stopped so the container exits and `restart: unless-stopped` brings both back in order,
which is the opposite of what an init system's restart-the-service semantics would do to a database. A data
directory from a different Postgres major is refused up front, with the upgrade path named, rather than
crash-looping on an error nobody should have to decode. Docker's own healthcheck asks Postgres too when it
is inside, and the admin overview says which layout this is in one word.

The browser end-to-end suite now drives both layouts on every commit, and the entrypoint itself is driven
as a script with fake Postgres binaries that record their arguments. That harness caught two mistakes before
they shipped: the socket directory was never created when the container runs as a non-root `user:`, and the
app was launched through a shell function in the background -- which puts it in a subshell, so the signal
sent on `docker stop` would have stopped the subshell and left the app running with its database gone.

## v0.17.0 — 2026-09-04

### The API has a reference now, and it cannot fall behind

Every route the app has -- all 184 of them -- is described in one OpenAPI file, and the app serves it at
**`/api/docs`**: a browsable reference with "try it out", authenticated with the same token you would use
from a script. Each operation says what it does, what it takes, what it answers and how it is gated, and the
security schemes match the three ways in: a session or API token, the image cookie, the OPDS password.

The point is not the file but the test behind it. A hand-written reference goes stale the day someone adds
a route and forgets it; this one is checked against the routes the server actually registers, in both
directions, every time the suite runs, and so is the route list in `docs/api.md` -- which turned out to be
one short, with nothing to say so. The served version number must match the package too, so a release
cannot ship a reference claiming to be an older API.

## v0.16.0 — 2026-09-03

### An OPDS reader can read page by page, and filter what it sees

Until now an OPDS reader could do one thing with a chapter: download the whole CBZ. Panels, Chunky and
KOReader all stream pages over OPDS-PSE when a feed offers it -- the reader fetches page one, then page
two, and a long chapter starts in a second instead of after a download -- so every chapter entry now
carries the stream link: a page template, the page count, and where *this* reader last stopped, taken from
its own reading progress. Without a width the original page comes back, from the same cache the web reader
uses; ask for a width and you get a JPEG no wider than that. A reader that does not know the extension sees
nothing different and keeps downloading.

The series feeds carry facets: sort, library, genre and status, each with how many of your series it would
leave, marked when in force, and combinable. Search is now the same feed as the listing, so it pages and
filters too, where before it stopped at sixty hits with no way past them. Counts come from the same gated
source as the listing, and a library is only offered as a filter when you can see more than one -- a count
is a disclosure, and "Library (1)" would have said a hidden one exists.

Every `<updated>` in the catalogue was the moment of the request. A reader that checks for changes saw the
whole library change on every fetch. A series now carries its newest chapter's time, a chapter its own, and
a feed the newest of its entries.

### 18+ libraries in a reader, if that reader is the one you want them in

The web app has a reveal button for 18+ libraries; an OPDS reader has no button, so it always got them
hidden, with no way to ask. The choice now lives on the OPDS credential itself -- **Profile → External
readers → Include 18+ libraries in this reader** -- off by default, and per credential rather than per
account, because the phone in a pocket and the e-reader on the shelf are different audiences for the same
person. Your age limit, if you have one, applies whatever the switch says; that is a permission, and this is
not.

### Two things found on the way

**The chapter list of a series answered 500, and had since v0.8.0.** The query behind
`/opds/series/:id` reused the parameter list of the lookup above it, so Postgres was handed a value it could
never type and refused the whole statement. It shipped that way on 2026-08-23 and has been in every release
since; nobody on this install had opened a chapter list in a reader, which is the only reason it stayed
quiet. It works now, and the test drives it over HTTP against a real archive.

**Paging links were escaped twice.** A reader paging past sixty series was sent `&amp;amp;page=1`, decoded
that to a query key named `amp;page`, and started again from page one. Links are now built raw and escaped
exactly once, where they are written.

## v0.15.1 — 2026-09-03

### A source behind Cloudflare gets the time its challenge takes

Every wait in the app was one number regardless of how a source answers. A plain site answers in a second;
a site behind Cloudflare answers only after the solver has driven a real browser through a challenge, which
for the source that carries most of this library takes about a minute. The nightly sweep gave a listing 20
seconds and lost 15 of that source's series to it, every sweep. The fill scan gave a search 45 seconds and
lost the same source at exactly the moment it mattered. A minute-long challenge against a 20-second wait is a
structural loss, not a flaky site.

Sources that need the solver now get a budget that fits it (`SOLVER_BUDGET_MS`, 90 seconds) for listings,
searches and the add path; everything else keeps the short waits it had.

### Chapters that keep failing identically are left alone

Over three sweeps the same seventeen chapters failed three times each with the same page counts (94 of 95,
151 of 176), nothing that had failed twice ever landed, and together they cost 26 of every 150 download
attempts, every sweep, indefinitely. After three failed tries (`CHAPTER_RETRY_CAP`) the sweep now leaves a
chapter alone and says how many it skipped. The health page shows them with their counts, "find missing
chapters" on the series still fetches them on purpose, and the moment one lands its record clears itself.

### One series got its source back

*The Avenger's Reincarnation Eldmia Ega* had been frozen since its extension was removed on 20 August. It is
now pointed at Mangakakalot, which lists it under "Eldmia Ega, the Reincarnated Avenger", and picked up two
of its four newer chapters straight away.

## v0.15.0 — 2026-09-03

### Extensions now actually update themselves

Uchiyomi has had an automatic extension updater since v0.11. On the install it was written for it had, as far
as can be told, never updated a single extension.

The reason is one missing call. Suwayomi does not poll its repositories; it recalculates "an update is
available" only when it is told to re-read them. Uchiyomi asked for that in exactly three places, all of them
buttons in Admin. The nightly job that installed updates was not one of them. So every night it read a
catalogue whose freshness depended on somebody having pressed **Refresh**, found nothing marked as updatable,
and reported a clean run. Fifteen extensions installed, zero flagged, while the repository behind them
published roughly every fifteen hours.

Extension updates are now their own scheduled task, running every 6 hours, and the first thing it does is
re-read the repositories. It appears in **Admin → Server → Tasks** with its last run, its result and a **Run
now** button, and it can be switched off in Settings, in which case it still tells you what is waiting.

**Update all** had the same bug and is fixed the same way: it refreshes before it updates, so it can no
longer tell you everything is up to date by consulting a catalogue from three weeks ago.

While fixing that, four related things that were invisible:

- **A repository that cannot be read is no longer silence.** An unreachable repository and a genuinely
  up-to-date library produced identical output. A failed refresh is now a named outcome, shown in the panel
  and pushed once — not once per check, because an engine that is down stays down.
- **Your repository list survives the engine's volume.** It was stored only inside the extension engine, in
  the volume people delete when it misbehaves, and it was not in the nightly backup. Uchiyomi now keeps its
  own copy, adopts whatever the engine has on first run, and puts the list back — along with the extensions
  you had installed — if that volume is wiped. It cannot restore which series came from which extension;
  nothing outside the engine ever knew those ids.
- **Abandoned extensions are named.** An installed extension no repository offers any more keeps working and
  will never update again. It is now reported. It is never uninstalled: that would orphan every series routed
  through it.
- **Updates wait for the chapter updater.** Swapping an extension out while a library sweep is using it
  breaks that sweep's downloads. The check now defers, and says that it did.

An extension you remove in the engine's own interface stays removed. The check reports it and leaves it alone.

## v0.14.4 — 2026-09-03

### The extension engine can no longer download into its own volume, and says when it is down

Three compose files describe the same optional extension engine, and they had drifted. The development file
set `AUTO_DOWNLOAD_CHAPTERS: "false"` and explained in a comment that the engine "must never write into" the
library. `deploy/docker-compose.yml` -- the file the README tells you to download -- set only the timezone.

So an install done the documented way ran an engine that would download chapters into its own Docker volume
the first time a series from an extension source was followed: a second copy of the library that nothing
manages, prunes, backs up, or shows you. Both deploy files now carry the setting, and a test compares all
three so they cannot drift again.

The engine also had no healthcheck in any file, so a wedged JVM was indistinguishable from a healthy one in
`docker ps` and the only symptom was the app timing out. It has one now. It is written with bash rather than
curl because the image ships no curl, wget or nc, and it treats 401 as alive -- an engine with authentication
switched on is up, not broken.

Deliberately no `depends_on`: the service is optional and the compose file tells you how to remove it, and a
`depends_on` pointing at a removed service makes `docker compose up` fail outright.

Also:

- `.env.example` documents the `SUWAYOMI_*` variables. The extensions guide told you to edit `.env`, and the
  example file it referred to had never mentioned them.
- The comment above the extensions API said Uchiyomi "never fetches or installs extension APKs itself" and
  that installing was a link out to the engine's own interface. That stopped being true the day the catalogue
  was written, ninety lines below it.

## v0.14.3 — 2026-09-03

### "Find missing chapters" stops calling sources broken for waiting their turn

With many sources installed, the scan asked all of them at once. The Cloudflare solver runs four at a time,
so most of the queue spent its entire 45 second budget waiting for a slot and was then reported as "could
not be reached". In one real scan, 16 of 21 candidates were sources that never got a turn.

Three changes:

- A search's clock starts when it starts, not while it waits. The scan now holds a solver slot before the
  timer runs, so a source is only "unreachable" if it actually failed to answer.
- Sources are asked in a sensible order: the series' own source, then sources in its language, then sources
  that publish in several languages, and only then sources pinned to another language.
- The scan stops asking once enough sources have the title (three, `SCAN_ENOUGH`). Sources it did not get to
  are listed as "not asked", which is what they are, rather than as broken or as not having it.

Nothing about which sources are installed or enabled changed; only how the scan uses them.

## v0.14.2 — 2026-09-03

### Small things that were quietly wrong

Each of these was known and written down a week ago. None was the biggest thing at the time, and all of
them are the kind of defect that produces no error and no log line.

- **A stale tab could rewind your place.** The server refuses a progress write older than the one it has,
  but only when the write carries a timestamp. The offline queue always sent one; the live path never did,
  so every live ping was accepted unconditionally, and a desktop tab left open on chapter 3 could still
  rewind the phone that had read to chapter 9. The live write now carries its clock.
- **Two definitions of "gap".** The health page and "find missing chapters" each computed missing chapters
  their own way, and on a series that starts at chapter 0 and jumps to 93 they disagreed: health said no
  gaps, the dialog offered to fetch 92. Both green in their own tests. There is one definition now, the
  dialog's, and the health page uses it.
- **Chapters were written less carefully than the thumbnail cache.** A chapter file was written straight
  onto its final name, and the "already downloaded" check is a bare look for that name, so a container
  restarted mid-download could leave a half-chapter that was then skipped forever. The cache already wrote
  to a temporary name and renamed on success; the library now does too, and abandoned temporaries are
  swept on boot. The nightly database dump gets the same treatment, so a backup interrupted halfway does not
  masquerade as a completed one.
- **The safe backend is now the default.** `LIBRARY_BACKEND` had to be exactly `owned` for the permission
  model to apply; unset or misspelled, the code fell back to the legacy mode whose model is "the other
  server enforces it", which on this backend means no restriction at all, on the path that serves page
  images and OPDS downloads. Every compose file sets the variable, which is exactly why nobody noticed. Only
  an explicit `komga` selects the legacy mode now.
- **Deploys no longer starve the nightly sweep.** The first sweep after boot waited a full interval, so
  every deploy pushed it out by six hours; on a day with three releases the library did not update at all,
  measured. The time of the last completed sweep is now kept, and a restart schedules whatever remains of
  the interval, with a ten-minute floor.
- **Stopping the server stops the sweep at a chapter boundary.** There was no signal handler at all: a
  restart mid-sweep killed it mid-chapter, the job card kept polling a run that no longer existed, and
  nothing recorded that it had been interrupted rather than finished. The sweep now ends between chapters
  on SIGTERM and reports `stopped: shutdown`.

## v0.14.1 — 2026-09-03

### The fill dialog stops recommending sources that have never worked

"Find missing chapters" checked one thing before offering a source: whether its cooldown had lapsed. Not its
record. So a source could be offered as a clean option while sitting in a nineteen-deep failure streak, or
having never once completed a download here. WeebCentral had refused every image byte since June, and
because listing chapters still worked it rendered as a confident "Fetch 12 chapters" button.

Hiding those sources would have been the obvious fix, and it would have been wrong: a streak is cleared only
by a successful download, which is the very thing hiding it prevents. So the dialog now shows the record
under the button instead: "Recently unreliable · refused us 3 times in a row · never completed a download
here". The decision stays with the person, with the facts in front of them.

### Series that can never update are now said out loud

When an extension is removed, the series that came from it keep reading fine and quietly stop updating
forever. The nightly sweep counted them as "unrouted" and threw the count away; their health row, if any,
said fine because nothing had ever been asked. One series had been frozen that way for twelve days.

The health page now lists them, with the fix: re-add the extension, or point the series at a source that
carries it.

### Removing an extension no longer leaves its health rows behind

Uninstalling deleted the sources but not their health rows, which had accumulated a dozen orphans, three of
them recording 404s from the evening their extensions were pulled. They are now removed with the extension,
except for a source that still has series, whose row is the only record those series ever had a home.

## v0.14.0 — 2026-09-02

### The nightly sweep stopped sabotaging itself

Last night's sweep reported `ok=61, blocked=164`. One chapter came up 25 images short, and those 25 had
arrived as HTTP 200 with nothing in them, which turned out to be the one kind of page failure that set no
status at all. The blame code fell through to its harshest default, a 30-minute cooldown, on the source
that carries 192 of your 226 series. Every later series on that source was skipped for the night. Nothing
was logged.

Four things changed, each measured before it was written:

- **An empty body is not a refusal.** A CDN answering 200 with nothing behind it now reads as "not serving",
  the 5-minute tier, and only when more than half the chapter is missing. Half the chapter arriving as real
  images proves the CDN is up and the holes are per-image.
- **The sweep has a budget**, 150 attempts by default (`UPDATER_SWEEP_MAX`). That fits inside the six-hour
  interval and drains the backlog the moved-domain fix uncovered in about three weeks, instead of hitting it
  as hard as possible every night. Chapters already on disk cost nothing against it.
- **Sources take turns.** One queue per source, visited round-robin, least-recently-checked first. A source
  that goes into a cooldown parks its own queue and nobody else's, and whatever a sweep leaves unvisited goes
  first next time instead of never. Under the old order the 54 series furthest behind sorted last.
- **The disk has a floor**, 10 GiB by default (`MIN_FREE_GB`). Nothing checked free space before; the first
  sign would have been a half-written chapter.

The sweep's log line now says how many series it visited and whether the budget or the disk stopped it.

### Failures are written down

A chapter that would not download was a bumped counter. "12 chapters could not be saved" was the whole
record: which series, which chapter, which source and why existed nowhere, and the next sweep tried the
same ones again. Every failure now logs one line naming all four, and is kept per chapter with how many
times it has been tried. The health page lists them by source, and the entry disappears the moment the
chapter lands.

The admin overview also says how far behind the library is, from what each source said the last time it
was asked. Until now that number could not be known without asking every source again.

## v0.13.2 — 2026-09-02

### Sidebar covers were being counted as chapter pages

Chapter pages are read out of the reader block on the page. When that block did not match, the code fell
back to scanning the *whole* document, and these sites carry a sidebar of other series. Measured on one
chapter: 96 "pages", the last of which was the cover of a completely unrelated title.

That is not cosmetic. The number of page URLs is what a chapter is measured against, so junk entries make a
chapter that fetched every real page still look short. A short chapter is refused, and a big enough
shortfall is reported as the *source* failing. A parsing slip was being charged to the site, and then the
site was put in a cooldown for it.

Covers are now never counted, and a chapter's pages are taken from the one directory they all share, so a
handful of sidebar images cannot survive even when the block match fails.

### We were crashing the Cloudflare solver ourselves

Looking for missing chapters searches every source you have. It did that all at once, and the solver drives
real browsers, so a dozen simultaneous challenges made it log "Task queue depth is 4" and then
"Error starting Chrome". A crashed solve arrives looking exactly like the site refusing us, so the fan-out
was manufacturing source failures out of nothing.

Solves are now capped at four at a time (`SOLVER_CONCURRENCY`).

### A source that could not be reached said nothing at all

If a search threw or timed out, the source was dropped from the results silently, which looks identical to
"that source does not have this title". Aqua Manga holds 192 of the 224 series here, and it was being
dropped from *every* scan because its Cloudflare challenge takes about 63 seconds against a 20 second
budget. Nothing anywhere said so.

Sources that could not be asked are now listed with the reason, and the budget was raised to 45 seconds so
a source waiting its turn behind the new solver cap is not counted as broken.

## v0.13.1 — 2026-09-02

### Downloads stopped going too fast and then blaming the site

"Act Like a Boss Monster, Mr. Swallow!" would not fill its missing chapters, 34 to 92, from any source. Six
attempts over three days put zero chapters into that gap. The sites were not the problem. We were.

A chapter here is 110 to 130 images. The pause that existed was between *chapters*, not between images, so
each chapter went out as a burst of a hundred-odd requests back to back, two chapters at a time. Measured at
the moment it broke: about two images a second, sustained for minutes. Both sites eventually said "slow
down" (HTTP 429), which is a fair thing for them to say. We were not banned: at a third of a request per
second the same hosts served us normally minutes later.

What happened next is the part that was mine. A 429 arrives with the remedy attached, namely how long to
wait. That instruction was only honoured if at least one image had already arrived. When the very first
image was refused, the whole wait-and-retry step was skipped, so the chapter was written off as
"0 of 115 pages" 1.28 seconds after a single request, the source was put in a cooldown, and because a
cooldown ends the entire run, the other 58 chapters were abandoned untried. Every attempt died inside
chapter 34.

The nightly sweep then compounded it. It was the one place that did not stop when a source refused, so it
asked for four more chapters that were never going to arrive, and each refusal lengthened the cooldown:
15 minutes, then 30, 45, 60, 75. A single burst locked the source for over an hour, which is why trying
again by hand did not work either.

Three changes:

- A quarter of a second between images. A 120-page chapter takes about 30 seconds longer. A cooldown took
  75 minutes.
- A 429 is now waited out and the chapter resumes where it stopped, up to three times, going slower after
  each one. A source still refusing after that is genuinely refusing, and is treated exactly as before.
- The nightly sweep stops at the first refusal, which is what both other callers already did.

One more thing worth knowing: trying "a different source" was less different than it looked. Mangakakalot
and Natomanga run the same engine here and serve their images from the same CDN, so five of the six
attempts were effectively the same site.

### The Cloudflare cookie that was never kept

Before fetching a chapter's images we ask the solver for a clearance cookie by loading the image host's
front page. An image CDN has no front page: it answers 403, the solver reports that as a block, and the
cookie was thrown away with it. Nothing was ever cached, so this repeated for every single chapter, and
every image was then fetched with no cookie at all, on exactly the hosts that were refusing us.

It now falls back to the image address we are about to fetch, which does exist and so can be solved, and
remembers a host that cannot be solved rather than asking again on every chapter.

## v0.13.0 — 2026-09-01

### Series kept asking a site that had moved

"Mr Devourer, Please Act Like a Final Boss" would not download anything new, and nor would most of the
library. Aqua Manga moved from aquareader.net to aquareader.org, the address was updated here, which is the
right thing to do, and it changed nothing. A series stores the full address it was added with, one per
series, so the 176 Aqua series added before the move went on asking the old host.

What hid it is the shape of the failure. The old host still answers. It just answers with a "page not found"
page rather than an error, so the fetch succeeded, the chapter list came back empty, and an empty chapter
list looks exactly like a series with nothing new. Every surface reported healthy, including the health
checks. All 176 series on the old address had gone a fortnight with no new file; of the 16 already on the new
one, 12 had not.

Now a stored address pointing at a host the site no longer uses is pointed at the current one as it is read.
Changing a site's address in settings is you saying it moved, and that now applies to series already in the
library rather than only to new ones. The series that was listing 0 chapters lists 142.

### Extensions say when they are out of date, and say when they cannot update

A failed extension update was invisible here. The nightly check tried, the attempt threw, and the error was
discarded on the spot: nothing logged, nothing shown, and no difference between "this failed" and "there was
nothing to do". The only trace was a stack trace in the extension server's own log, which is not somewhere
anyone looks.

- The extensions panel now says how many installed extensions are out of date, with an Update all button
  beside it. The per-extension Update button is unchanged.
- A failed update is reported with a reason in plain words. "HTTP error 404" becomes "the repository no
  longer offers that version to download", which is the repository's problem rather than yours.
- Admins are notified when an update fails, and both outcomes are written to the audit log.

Update all runs the same code the nightly check runs, rather than a second copy of it that could drift.

## v0.12.2 — 2026-09-01

### Asking a site to slow down, instead of ignoring it

v0.12.1 stopped a lost page from blaming the whole site, and it worked. Retrying the fill straight afterwards
got further and then stopped again, this time for a real reason: Mangakakalot asked us to slow down and we
kept asking anyway.

A chapter here is around a hundred images, fetched one after another with no pause between them. The pause
that exists is between *chapters*, not between pages. So three chapters in a row is a few hundred rapid
requests, and the site starts refusing. What made it worse is that the refusal changed nothing: the loop
carried on and asked for the remaining ninety-odd pages too, collected ninety-odd more refusals, and turned
a pause into a chapter that had lost most of itself.

Now, when a site says slow down, we stop asking, wait for as long as it asked for, and pick up the pages we
missed. In the ordinary case the chapter simply completes a few seconds later instead of failing.

If a site is still refusing after that wait, the run stops and says so, which is the same as before and is
the right thing: at that point it is not a blip, it is a no.

## v0.12.1 — 2026-09-01

### One missing page stopped blaming the whole site

You pressed "find missing chapters" and it fetched 3 of 92. That was my fault, not the sites'.

A chapter that comes back short is refused, because writing an incomplete one leaves a file that is then
skipped forever. That part was right. What was wrong is what happened next: it also marked the whole source
as failing and put it in a cooldown, no matter how small the shortfall. Two of your sources were sitting in
one over **98 of 101 pages** and **109 of 110**. Since every download run stops when a source starts
refusing, your 92-chapter fill stopped at the first chapter that lost a single image.

It was costing more than that one button. Across the last four nightly updates the library gained 26 chapters
and lost 40, with seven or eight series skipped each night for sources that were not really broken.

Three changes:

* **Pages that fail are asked for a second time.** Almost every one of these is a single image on a busy
  server that answers fine a moment later. One extra request, instead of losing the chapter and the day.
* **A shortfall is only the site's fault when it is a real one.** Losing a page or two out of a hundred is
  now recorded against that chapter and nothing else. Losing a fifth of a chapter, or being told no outright,
  still counts against the source exactly as before.
* **One bad chapter no longer ends the whole run.** It is skipped, counted and reported, and the rest of the
  run carries on.

The two sources have been let out of their cooldown, so the chapters you were waiting for can arrive.

## v0.12.0 — 2026-08-31

### Find missing chapters

A new button on every series page. It asks every source you have whether it carries this series, works out
which of your missing chapters it could supply, shows you what it found, and fetches only after you say yes.

v0.11.3 fixed the usual reason a series is short, and for most of them the nightly update now repairs itself.
This is for the rest: a series whose own source genuinely never had the early chapters, where the only way to
complete it is to take them from somewhere else.

**It asks before it fetches, and that is the whole point.** A chapter is stored under its number, so a chapter
taken from the wrong series lands exactly where the right one belongs, looks correct in every list, and is
only discovered by opening it. So the dialog shows you which source, what the series is called *there* (often
something quite different: yours is listed elsewhere as "Mr Devourer, Please Act Like a Final Boss"), how many
of your existing chapters line up, and how many it would add. Nothing is downloaded until you press a button
that repeats all of that back to you.

Sources it checked and rejected are listed too, with the reason, because "this one has it but numbers its
chapters differently" is worth seeing.

It will not offer:

* a source whose numbering does not line up with yours, which is what catches a series that restarts counting
  each season, and most cases of the wrong series entirely
* chapters before the beginning or after the end of what you have, since those are not gaps, they are simply
  where you have got to
* a hole where the two sides do not agree on the chapters either side of it
* anything at all on a series with fewer than three chapters, because there is not enough there to tell one
  series from another

If a source has it under a name too different to find, there is a box to search under that name instead.

Progress appears in the same downloads panel as everything else, and it keeps going if you close the dialog.

## v0.11.3 — 2026-08-31

### Series from Mangakakalot and Natomanga were arriving two-thirds empty

Someone opened a series and found chapter 93 was the first one in it. It was not that series: it was every
series from those two sites.

Both run on the same reader engine here, and the way it read a chapter list was to fetch the series page and
take the links out of it. That page only ever shows the newest fifty chapters, and it says so nowhere. There
is no "next page" to click, no "load more", no "showing 50 of 145". It is simply a list that stops. So every
series added from those two sites arrived with only its most recent fifty chapters, and the nightly update
could never repair it, because it kept asking the same page and kept getting the same fifty.

On this library that was **7 of the 10 series** from those sources, about **528 chapters** missing. The worst
was down to 8 chapters out of 76.

The page does name where the rest live: there is a proper chapter-list feed behind it, which the site's own
front end uses. The engine now reads that instead, following it to the end rather than stopping at the first
fifty, and falls back to reading the page the old way for the older sites that do not offer it.

Two of the affected series, before and after:

```
Act Like a Boss Monster, Mr. Swallow!    51  ->  145 chapters
Return of the War God                    57  ->  176 chapters
```

The missing chapters will fill in over the coming nights, oldest first.

**A second thing came free.** That feed also carries each chapter's real release date, which these two sites
never gave us any other way. New chapters from them will be properly dated instead of undated, so "released
3 months ago" on the series page starts being true for them.

## v0.11.2 — 2026-08-31

### Fixes "Loading chapter..." never finishing

A regression introduced by v0.11.1 the same day, and the reason to be sorry rather than pleased about it.

v0.11.1 moved the offline store to a new version so that downloaded chapters could belong to an account.
A browser will not change a database's version while anything else still has it open, and the service worker
had it open: it opened the store to send queued reading and never closed it again, on any path out. So the
upgrade waited for a worker that was never going to let go, the page waited for the upgrade, and the reader
waited for the page. Because the reader checks for a downloaded copy before it asks the server, that wait
happened before anything could be drawn, and every chapter showed "Loading chapter..." for good.

Three things changed, because any one of them alone leaves the door open:

* The service worker now closes the store on every path out, and steps aside immediately if a page needs to
  change the version while it is working.
* The page no longer waits indefinitely for a store it cannot open. If something is holding the old version,
  it gives up at once and reads online instead, and tries again next time rather than giving up for good.
* A store that cannot be opened now means "nothing is downloaded" rather than an error, so a cache that is
  unavailable can never stop you reading.

If you are stuck right now, closing every tab of the app and opening it again clears it, because that
releases the connection that is holding the upgrade.

This is squarely the same failure the previous two releases were spent on: something that could not answer,
where nothing was built to notice. The v0.11.0 work gave the reader a failure state, and a failure state does
not help when the answer never arrives at all. There is now a test that squats on the old version and asserts
the reader still gets an answer; with the shipped code it hangs until the runner is killed.

## v0.11.1 — 2026-08-30

### Two ways one account could reach another account's things

Both found by auditing the running instance rather than the code, and both are the same shape as the
sign-out fix in v0.11.0: something that is correct for one person and wrong the moment a device is shared.

**Downloaded chapters had no owner.** Offline chapters were stored under the chapter's id alone, with no
record of who downloaded them, and signing out did not remove them. The reader checks that store before it
asks the server, which means for anything downloaded the store IS the permission check. So on a shared
tablet or PC, one person could download chapters, sign out, and the next person to sign in could open them
by opening those chapters, with the age limit and the library permissions never consulted.

Everything downloaded is now filed under the account that downloaded it, and is simply not there for anyone
else. Signing back in brings your own downloads back, so this is scoping rather than deletion.

The same applied more quietly to reading that had not yet reached the server: a queue left behind by one
person would have been filed against whoever signed in next, taking their streak and leaderboard position
with it. Queued reading now waits for the person who did the reading.

**One thing to expect on this upgrade:** chapters downloaded before today are removed, because nothing about
them records who saved them and there is no honest way to assign an owner after the fact. They can be
downloaded again. Reading progress is untouched, including anything still queued.

**An internal detail was readable by any signed-in account.** One source-status route answered with the raw
health record, including the last error text, which names internal addresses and ports. The public route
fifteen lines above it goes out of its way not to publish that, and says so in a comment. The leaking one
was a duplicate of a properly restricted admin route that the admin page has always used instead, and
nothing else ever called it, so it is gone rather than merely restricted.

## v0.11.0 — 2026-08-30

### Twelve things that were failing without telling you

This release came out of auditing a running instance rather than reading the code, and everything in it has
the same shape: the app said nothing was wrong, and something was being lost anyway. They are listed roughly
by what they cost.

**Getting signed out at random.** One browser is one cookie jar, but it runs several refresh timers over it:
every open tab has its own, and so does the offline worker. Two tabs left open collided every twelve minutes,
and the one that lost the race deleted the login the winner had just written. Both tabs, and the whole
device, were signed out. On a family server that means someone locked out until an adult resets their
password. A login that was rotated a moment ago is now recognised for what it is. Signing out, or being
signed out by an admin, still takes effect instantly.

**Reading that vanished after a trip.** Chapters finished offline queue up and send when you reconnect. That
queue counted every failure the same way and deleted the entry on the fifth attempt, so a bad connection was
treated exactly like a corrupted record. Finish twenty chapters on a plane, land somewhere with a flaky
captive portal, and the lot was silently discarded: progress, streaks and Continue Reading all rewound. Only a
genuine, permanent rejection can discard something you read now.

**One person's library showing up for the next.** On a shared tablet, the stored copies of pages like your
home screen, history and stats were never cleared when you signed out, and one network hiccup was enough for
the next person to be shown them, including titles their age limit is meant to hide. Signing in or out now
clears them. The same store also had no size limit and grew forever, which on an iPhone eventually pushes out
your downloaded chapters.

**Restrictions that lifted themselves.** If the database stumbled while checking which libraries an account
may see, the answer came back as "all of them, with no age limit". That check now fails safe.

**Key art you should not have been able to see.** Every image route checks whether you may see the series.
One did not.

**Chapters filed under the wrong series.** Finishing a chapter let the app tell the server which series it
belonged to. After merging two duplicate entries, a phone that had been offline could file its reading under
the version that no longer exists, where it counted for nothing and quietly disappeared from Continue
Reading. The server works this out for itself now.

**A bookmark that jumped backwards.** A queued page from six hours ago could overwrite where you had since
read to on another device. Events now carry the time they happened, and the most recent one wins. Turning back
a page still works exactly as before.

**Nightly updates that could stop entirely.** Six different ways for the update sweep to fail all reported
"+0 chapters", which is also what a perfectly quiet night reports. Every source could have been broken for
weeks and the admin page would have looked fine. It now says which sources did not answer, and one hung site
no longer holds up the whole sweep.

**A black screen in the reader.** A damaged file, a library that is not mounted, or a chapter someone else
deleted all produced either a black screen with no explanation or, part-way through a series, the "You
finished" card. There is now a message saying which it is, and a Try again button.

**Deleting a member left no trace.** It is the most destructive thing the admin page can do, removing
someone's entire reading history, and it was the only action that recorded nothing. It now records what was
removed and who removed it.

**Backups that reported clean when they were not.** The backup already knew when it had failed to capture the
config folder, and knew when it could not measure itself, and then threw both facts away before anyone could
see them.

**Two things quietly filling the disk.** Half-written image files that the cleanup could not see, so it
reported the cache under its limit while the folder was over it; and failed offline downloads leaving page
data behind that nothing could reach, including "clear all downloads".

Nine new test files came with these, and every fix was checked by putting the original bug back and confirming
the test noticed.

## v0.10.2 — 2026-08-30

### The Add button stops being where you wait

v0.10.1 moved the downloading out from behind the button, and measuring the result showed the button still
took twenty-three seconds to answer. The reason turned out to be worse than slowness.

Opening the add window asks the site for the series and its chapter list, which is how it can tell you "120
chapters". Pressing Add then asked the site for exactly the same two things all over again, a few seconds
later, and asked for them one after the other rather than together. On a site behind a bot check, each of
those questions costs a real browser challenge, so opening the window and pressing Add paid for four of them
to learn two facts.

Both now share one answer, fetched once and remembered for a minute and a half. In the ordinary case —
open, glance, press Add — the button does no network work at all before replying.

The window's own opening pause is unchanged, because that part is the site's own cost rather than ours.

## v0.10.1 — 2026-08-29

### Adding a series tells you straight away

Pressing Add left the button saying "Working…" for up to a minute, and the only way to learn that it had in
fact started was to close the dialog and find it further down the Discover page. On one install that wait
was measured at fifteen, forty-eight and fifty-nine seconds.

The reason is that the request downloaded the whole first chapter before it answered. It no longer does.
Everything that decides what to tell you still happens first, so you are still told immediately if the title
is already in your library, if you have it from another source, or if there is nothing to download. Only the
fetching happens afterwards, which is what the app was already doing for every chapter after the first.

**Downloads now follow you.** A small indicator appears wherever you are while anything is downloading,
showing what it is and how far along, and it opens to a list. Previously progress lived in one strip on
Discover, below the hero and hidden behind the add window itself, so navigating away meant losing sight of
it entirely.

**A download that fails now says why.** It names the source and how far it got, instead of the same single
sentence for every possible cause, and it stays until you dismiss it. Finished downloads now clear
themselves after a few minutes; before this they were never removed at all and simply accumulated.

Two smaller things this fixes. An add that took longer than two minutes used to report "Add failed" while
succeeding perfectly well in the background. And pressing Escape, or clicking outside the window, while an
add was in flight closed it and left you with no confirmation at all.

## v0.10.0 — 2026-08-28

### Discover shows you where things come from, and lets you choose

The row of source names above the wall was information and nothing else: which sources were asked, and how
each one answered. It is now the place you steer from.

**Sources show their own icons.** Extension sources have always sent one; the app fetched it and threw it
away. Sites you added yourself now show their own favicon, and anything without a usable icon gets a
lettered tile in a colour of its own rather than a blank square.

**Tap a source to see only its titles**, and tap again to go back to all of them. This is instant and
changes nothing about what is loading: every source carries on filling in behind the filter, so there is no
waiting and nothing to lose by trying it.

**Newest or Popular**, for the whole wall. This is each source's *own* ranking rather than anything this
server works out — most sites already publish a popularity listing beside their recently-updated one, and
extensions have always offered both. Sources that cannot offer one step aside while Popular is chosen.
Switching between the two is instant the second time, because neither view discards the other's work.

## v0.9.12 — 2026-08-28

### The rest of the missing covers

v0.9.11 fixed two ways a listing could go wrong and left a third in place. Sites of one family were still
returning a wall where half the entries had no artwork.

A listing page carries more than its listing: alongside it sit "popular" and "recommended" panels, and those
links look enough like results to be mistaken for them. They also appear near the top of the page, so they
were taking places from real entries — and since those panels show no thumbnails, the places they took came
out blank. The listing itself is now read on its own, and the panels beside it are left alone. Sites that
lay their pages out differently are unaffected.

Measured against a live listing: twenty-four titles, twenty-four covers, where before thirteen of the
twenty-four had none.

## v0.9.11 — 2026-08-28

### Covers come back, and chapters stop pretending to be series

Two separate faults, both visible on the Discover wall as cards that were wrong rather than missing, so
nothing anywhere reported a problem.

**Half of some walls were not series at all.** A listing page shows each title alongside its newest
chapters, and both live at similar addresses. The reader was treating those chapter links as if they were
series, so a wall of twenty-four could be twelve real titles and twelve entries called "Chapter 2" or
"Chapter 156" — each with no cover, because a chapter page has none to show. This arrived in v0.9.8 and is
now gone: only a link to a series itself is accepted.

**Some sites returned every title with no artwork.** Sites built on the same engine do not agree on how they
mark up a thumbnail, and only one of the conventions was recognised. A site using the other returned a full
wall of blank cards. Both are now read, along with a third arrangement some themes use.

Fixing that surfaced a third fault underneath. Where a site provides a placeholder image and the real cover
separately — which is how a page avoids loading every picture at once — which of the two was picked came
down to the order the site happened to write them in, rather than to any preference. Sometimes the
placeholder won, and a card showed a grey square. The real cover is now chosen deliberately.

Also worth stating, since it looks like a bug and is not: a listing showing fifteen cards for six series is
correct. A title appears once for each of its recent chapters, and collapsing those into one result is the
right answer.

## v0.9.10 — 2026-08-28

### A slow source is no longer treated as a broken one

Discover gives each source a few seconds to return its newest page. When that ran out, the source was
recorded as having failed, and a failing source is put aside for five to thirty minutes — during which it is
not asked at all. So a source that was merely slower than the time allowed was punished by having taken away
from it the only thing that could have shown it working, and the punishment grew each time.

That is not a hypothetical. On the install this was found on, the largest source — holding 190 of 215 series
— answered perfectly well in about eleven and a half seconds, against a budget of eight. It disappeared from
Discover for a day while every health check, which allows itself far longer, kept correctly reporting it
healthy. The two were never measuring the same thing.

Running out of our own patience is now recorded as its own fact. It cannot escalate, and it cannot make a
slow source look like a blocked one. A single slow answer costs the source nothing at all. Only once it is
clearly a pattern does the source get a short, fixed pause — enough that browsing does not spend the whole
budget on the same source over and over, never enough to hide it — and it is ranked below sources that
answer in time rather than removed. A page that arrives in time clears the record.

A source in that state now says so plainly, and names the setting to change and the number it keeps
exceeding, instead of reporting an unexplained failure.

Sites that genuinely refuse us are unaffected: those still back off hard, because asking a refusing site
again soon costs something and gains nothing.

## v0.9.9 — 2026-08-28

### The source check no longer cries wolf

The first real run of the daily check reported the healthiest source on a live install as blocked. It was
working: 190 series, answering normally.

The check asks each site directly, on purpose, without the Cloudflare solver in the way, because that is
what separates "the site is down" from "the solver is broken". But a site behind Cloudflare answers a
request like that with a refusal every single time. That is the challenge page, not a verdict, and it was
being read as one.

Two corrections. A source that just demonstrated it can search, list chapters and serve pages is now
reported as working, whatever a bare request to its homepage made of it. And a refusal to such a request is
no longer treated as evidence for sources that reach their site through the solver, since for those it is
simply the expected answer.

The check also gets longer to work with. A source behind the solver makes several requests in sequence, each
taking a few seconds, and the old budget was tight enough that a healthy source could run out of time
mid-check, which then became the wrong conclusion rather than no conclusion.

## v0.9.8 — 2026-08-27

### Sources are now checked for you

A source that dies quietly stays dead. It answers with an empty page, throws no error, records nothing, and
goes on reporting itself healthy. One install ran six weeks that way: its main site, holding 189 of 215
series, had its domain quietly repurposed into an unrelated website, and the only symptom was that some dots
on Discover looked wrong.

There is now a daily check. It asks each site directly, exercises the source end to end, and writes down
what it finds. Two things it fixes by itself, because both have exactly one correct answer and both can be
verified before committing to them:

- **A site that has moved** is followed to its new address, but only after the new address proves it can
  still search, list chapters and serve pages. If it cannot, the change is rolled back. This matters more
  than it sounds: on the install this was built for, one dead site redirected to a chat community and
  another to a page serving "404 Not Found" with a success code. Both would have looked like moves.
- **Extensions with an update available** are updated.

Everything else is reported rather than acted on: a site refusing the server, a listing that has changed
shape, a host that has gone. Those need a judgement call, and disabling a source over what turns out to be a
two-hour outage is worse than leaving it be. Admins get a notification when something needs them, and
Admin, Sources, Providers has a **Check all now** button that runs the identical sweep on demand.

### Two sources repaired

Manganato-engine sites had stopped listing anything. The path the engine asked for, `/genre-all`, now
answers successfully with a page containing no series at all, which is exactly the silent failure above. It
now asks for the current listing path and keeps the old one as a fallback for sites that still serve it.

## v0.9.7 — 2026-08-27

### The trending hero shows the slides it has

v0.9.6 took the hero from five titles to ten and then hid the fact. Its position dots are drawn as a sliding
window, capped so that a long carousel cannot push the row off the side of a phone, and that cap was applied
at every screen size. The row therefore looked identical whether it held five slides or ten.

The overflow it guards against was only ever a phone problem. The window now follows the space available:
every dot on a desktop, the compact window on a phone.

## v0.9.6 — 2026-08-27

### Failing sources now say what is wrong, and what to do about it

Discover showed a dot beside each source: green when it came back with covers, grey when it did not. Grey
turned out to mean four unrelated things, and the two worth knowing about were invisible.

A source serving out a cooldown is never asked at all, so it returns an empty list and looks exactly like a
healthy source with nothing new. And an empty answer was recorded nowhere: a Cloudflare check served as an
ordinary page, or a site that had changed its layout, produced no error, so nothing was ever written down.
A source could be broken for weeks while looking merely quiet.

Both are now visible. An empty answer is counted without being treated as a failure, which matters: several
sites answer a failed check with an empty page rather than an error, and treating that as success would wipe
a cooldown that was recorded for good reason. A source that keeps answering with nothing is marked as such,
sorted below the ones that work, and says so on Discover with an estimate of when it will be tried again.

Admin, Sources, Providers gains a **Test** button. It goes and looks at the site right now, deliberately
without the Cloudflare solver in the way, then exercises the source end to end and reports which step failed.
That distinction is the whole point: a site that answers this server directly while the solver is failing is
a solver problem, not a site problem, and those two were indistinguishable before.

The reason is written in plain language with a suggested fix, rather than as the raw recorded error. Five
different faults used to record the single word "timeout".

Custom sites can finally have their address changed. Previously the only options were add and delete, and
deleting loses the link to every series that came from that source, so following a site to a new domain
meant orphaning your library.

### The Cloudflare solver stops failing silently

Chrome cannot run in Docker's default 64 MB of shared memory. It was crashing mid-check, and the app
faithfully reported that as the *sites* blocking us. The solver also leaks memory, reaching 2.5 GB after two
months here, and a bloated one fails in that same misleading way.

It now gets the memory it needs, a cap so a leak restarts it instead of degrading it, and a health check, so
"running" and "working" stop being the same thing. The health page carries it as its own line and points at
it directly when several sources fail at once and all of them blame it.

Also fixed: the health page's count of how many series depend on a source, which compared a display name to
an id and so always reported zero.

### More on the Discover hero

The trending hero rotates through ten titles instead of five, a little quicker, and preloads the next one.

Raising the number alone would have done nothing on a large library. The hero only used titles with wide
banner art, and of forty trending titles only sixteen have any; on a 215-series library just seven survived
the filter for things you do not already own. It now fills the remaining slots from titles with ordinary
cover art, which it already knew how to display.

## v0.9.5 — 2026-08-27

### Discover no longer stalls, and the language chips are gone

Switching language before the wall had finished loading left covers stuck loading, sometimes for the rest of
the session. That was a bug, not slowness.

Each source on the wall reports back when it settles. The report fires on a change, and a source that
appeared under both the old and the new language never changed: it kept its place, kept its cached answer,
and so never reported again — while the page had just forgotten it. The wall was then permanently waiting on
a source that had already answered, which is why the loading tiles never resolved, the progress bar stuck,
and scrolling for more stopped working.

Two things made it worse. Switching could fire ten requests at once instead of four. And nothing was
cancelled, so every abandoned request still cost the server its full eight-second budget — and a request that
times out puts that source on a cooldown for the next five to thirty minutes. Clicking impatiently actively
made the wall emptier.

**The language chips are removed.** They were the trigger, and the thing they were solving is better solved
by ranking: healthy sources first, then the ones your library actually came from. The source chips above the
wall are the filter now, and they still show which sources are being asked and how each one answered.

The causes are fixed separately from the trigger, since the same failure would return the moment anything
else restarted the wall. Requests are now cancelled when abandoned, so changing your mind no longer costs a
source its availability for half an hour.

Also fixed: with the add dialog open on the hero, every source that finished loading refired a search across
every source — a fan-out with a 25-second timeout each, over and over, while the wall filled in behind it.

### A sharper sign-in wall on high-DPI screens

The cover wall behind the sign-in screen looked soft on a 2K display. A screen at that pixel ratio asks for
5120 pixels of image and was handed 2560, then stretched them. There is a larger twin now, and the page picks
it only on screens that can use it — an ordinary display still takes the small one.

## v0.9.4 — 2026-08-26

### A wall of covers behind the sign-in screen

The login screen sat on a single piece of key art. It now sits behind a tilted grid of cover tiles, which is
what a manga library should look like before you have signed into it.

The tiles are cut from the art Uchiyomi already ships — the twelve genre backdrops plus the login, splash,
wrapped, hero and section pieces — at several crop positions each, because at wall scale a different crop of
one image reads as a different book. Seventeen sources give fifty-nine tiles. `scripts/login-wall.py`
composes them and is seeded, so it rebuilds the same wall every time.

**It is deliberately not your library.** The sign-in screen is pre-authentication, so anything on it is
visible to anyone who can reach your server. Feeding it real covers would serve titles and art straight past
per-library access, per-user age caps and the 18+ hide, and the service worker would then keep those covers
in a cache that survives signing out on a shared device. The wall is generated art, and the sign-in screen
still requests no images from your library at all.

Also fixed: the backdrop's entrance animation ignored `prefers-reduced-motion`. The CSS rule that handles
this everywhere else cannot reach a JavaScript animation, so that screen never honoured the setting.

## v0.9.3 — 2026-08-25

### The dependency tree answers for itself

Turning on GitHub's vulnerability alerts surfaced **49 findings** across the two lockfiles, four of them
critical. This release clears them.

**The ones that were real.** The API ran `fast-jwt` 4 — the library that verifies every login token — which
has since accumulated three critical advisories (auth bypass via an empty HMAC secret with async key
resolvers, cache confusion that can return one token's claims for another, and an algorithm-confusion fix
bypass). None of the three is reachable with Uchiyomi's configuration, which uses a static HS256 secret and
no RSA — but "not reachable today" is not an argument for keeping a known-broken verifier under the auth
system. Alongside it: `@fastify/static` (route-guard bypass via path traversal — it serves the web app in
the single container), `fastify` itself (a Content-Type parsing quirk that bypasses body validation),
`sharp` (inherited libvips CVEs — it processes untrusted images downloaded from sources), and `adm-zip`
(a crafted ZIP forcing a 4 GB allocation — it opens CBZs fetched from sources).

All of those fixes live on the far side of a framework major, so the whole family moved together:
**Fastify 4 → 5** with `@fastify/jwt` 10 (carrying `fast-jwt` 6.3), `@fastify/static` 10, and new majors of
compress, helmet, cors, cookie and rate-limit; plus `sharp` 0.35 and `adm-zip` 0.6. The entire 476-test
suite, the mounted-route wiring tests and the browser end-to-end pass unchanged on the new major — and
tokens signed by the old verifier still verify under the new one (and vice versa), so **nobody is signed
out by upgrading**, or by rolling back.

**The ones that were theoretical.** Thirty findings pointed at Next.js. The web app is a **static export**:
there is no Next server, no middleware, no Server Actions and no image optimizer running anywhere in
production, so none of those advisories was reachable. They are cleared anyway — **Next 14 → 15, React
18 → 19** — because an install page full of open advisories makes a reader do the reachability analysis
themselves. Next also vendors its own old copy of `postcss`; an override pins the patched one everywhere.

One finding remains open by necessity: `extract-zip`, a development-only dependency of the browser-test
harness, has no patched release to move to. It never ships in any image.


### The repo now runs what it ships

Cloning the repo and running `docker compose up -d` gave you the deprecated two-container split, while every
document told you the install is one container. `scripts/setup.sh` did the same, and the README offered it as
a normal alternative to the browser setup step without saying which layout it started.

`docker compose up -d` now builds **`yomi-app`** from `Dockerfile.aio` — the same single container the
released image ships and the only layout the end-to-end tests drive. The split is still there and still
buildable from source, because its images are still published on every release; it moved behind a profile:

```bash
docker compose --profile split up -d     # yomi-bff + yomi-web, on SPLIT_WEB_PORT (8081)
```

It gets its own port on purpose: the profile adds services rather than replacing them, so both would
otherwise fight over the same one.

`setup.sh` follows, and gained a guard — it refuses to run in a checkout whose `docker-compose.override.yml`
manages a service it does not, so it can no longer rebuild and restart a server's live install from the
working tree. It also chowns volumes to the configured `PUID`/`PGID` instead of a hardcoded 10002, which was
already wrong for anyone running as the owner of their library.

**`WEB_PORT` is 8080 everywhere now.** It was 3000 in the development stack and 8080 in the shipped one, and
`.env.example` hard-set the development values while `docs/USAGE.md` tells you to copy that file to point
`LIBRARY_PATH` at your library — so following the docs moved the app off the port the same page had just
told you to open, and left `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` pointing somewhere else again. Both are now commented out in
`.env.example`, so the compose default wins unless you deliberately change them.

## v0.9.2 — 2026-08-25

### The single container could not back itself up, and said nothing

**If you run the all-in-one image, your backups have been empty since v0.9.0.** `Dockerfile.aio` never
installed the Postgres client, so `pg_dump` was not in the image. `bff/Dockerfile` installs it and always
has, with a comment saying it is there for the backup task; the line was simply never carried across when
the single-container image was written.

Nothing about it was visible. The task wrote a 20-byte empty archive into a directory that looks like a
backup, logged nothing at all, and left `backup_last_result` untouched — so the admin Tasks panel kept
reporting the last run that *had* worked. On an install migrated from the split layout, that was a real
backup written by the old containers, which is about the most convincing way to be told everything is fine.

Three things changed, because the missing package was only the first of them:

- The runtime installs `postgresql16-client`, exactly as the split image does.
- **A failed dump is now recorded as a failure.** The Tasks panel shows the error, and the manual
  Backup button no longer discards it. A run that fails also deletes its own directory, so rotation cannot
  count empty archives as backups and push the last good one out of retention.
- `pg_dump` missing by name gets a message that says so, instead of an ENOENT.

The dump helper also resolved too early: an empty pipe closes cleanly and gzip still emits its header, so
"the file finished writing" was treated as "the dump succeeded". It now requires the process to have exited
0 as well.

`bff/test/aioParity.test.ts` — which exists for exactly this, "the split image did something and the single
one quietly stopped" — now holds all of it. Worth saying that the first version of that guard did not work:
both Dockerfiles *explain* why the client is installed, so searching the file matched the comment that
survives deleting the instruction. It reads only what Docker executes now.

**Check your own install:** `docker exec <container> pg_dump --version`. No output means every backup you
have taken since v0.9.0 is empty. Compare the sizes in your backup directory — a real dump is megabytes, a
broken one is 20 bytes.

### Reading progress for a chapter that no longer resolves

`PUT /api/books/:id/progress` answered **500** when it could not look the chapter up. The route fell back to
a placeholder series id, and migration `0004` had since given `read_progress` a foreign key to `lib_series` —
so that fallback could only ever violate the constraint.

The client that reaches it is the offline outbox replaying a queued page for a series deleted or merged in
the meantime. A 500 is retried forever; a **404** lets the queue drop the entry, which is what it now gets.

### One container is the install now

The docs used to present two layouts as equals, which meant three published images and a reader having to
pick before they knew anything. The single container is now the only one the instructions describe, and the
default filename went with it: `deploy/docker-compose.yml` is the single container, and the two-container
split moved to `deploy/docker-compose.split.yml`.

**The split is deprecated, not removed.** Both images are still built and still published on every release.
Nothing about a running install has stopped working, and there is no deadline. Unpublishing them while
leaving the packages in place would be the worst of both worlds: `docker compose pull` would keep succeeding
and silently freeze people on the last release with nothing to tell them, which is exactly the trap the old
`koryomi-*` packages caused.

**There is now a migration guide**, which there never was: `docs/MIGRATING.md`. Both layouts use the same
named volumes and the same Postgres image, so moving is four commands and no data is copied or converted.
The one step that is easy to miss is repointing a reverse proxy, because nothing errors: it was aimed at
`uchiyomi-web:80`, and that container no longer exists.

The CasaOS manifest ships the single container too, so its store tile stops naming a container that would
not exist. And the screenshot rig, the proxy helper and the container names in the backup-and-restore
instructions all follow the same layout the reader is being told to run.

## v0.9.1 — 2026-08-25

### The single container compresses again

Moving the web tier into the API process quietly dropped the one thing nginx was doing that nobody thinks of
as an application concern: it gzipped CSS, JS, JSON, SVG and the manifest, and because `application/json` was
in that list, every API response too. The all-in-one image had no compression plugin at all.

Measured against a real install: a cold load went from **261 KB of JS and CSS to 736 KB**. Nothing breaks, it
just gets slower, and only noticeably off your own network. Fixed with `@fastify/compress`, which also offers
brotli, which nginx never had here at all.

It also sends `Vary: Accept-Encoding`, which nginx did **not**: it ran `gzip on` with no `gzip_vary`, so a
shared cache in front of it could hand a gzipped body to a client that never asked for one. That is a real
hazard closed, not merely parity restored.

### A healthcheck that means liveness

`/healthz` runs `SELECT 1`, which is the right answer for "should traffic be sent here" and the wrong one for
a container healthcheck: the single container pointed at it, so one database blip marked the whole app
unhealthy. In the split layout nginx answered `/healthz` itself and stayed up through an outage, still
serving the shell so the app could render an error rather than the browser showing connection refused.

There is now a `/livez` that answers unconditionally, and the container healthcheck uses it. `/healthz` is
unchanged and still the readiness probe.

### Also

The repository root had no `.dockerignore`, and `Dockerfile.aio` builds from the root, so `COPY web/ ./` and
`COPY bff/ ./` copied the host's `node_modules` straight over the ones `npm ci` had just installed one layer
earlier, native modules included. Continuous integration never saw it, because a fresh checkout has none. Local
builds dragged around 790 MB of context and could produce a wrong build from a stale tree.

## v0.9.0 — 2026-08-24

### Libraries you can actually build

A library is now **a folder, plus any series you file into it by hand**, and there is a way to pick that
folder: browse your library root at any depth, or type the path. Before, the only option was a list of
suggestions computed from the top level of the root — which on most installs holds the source names the
downloader wrote, so the only folders offered were the ones not to pick, and the one you wanted could not be
reached at all.

**Libraries may sit inside one another.** With `Manga` and `Manga/Seinen` both declared, the most specific
one wins. Removing the inner one hands its series back to `Manga`, not to the default library.

**An age rating on the library**, inherited by everything in it, so marking a shelf 18+ is one action rather
than two hundred. A single title can still be rated differently from its own page. Unrated stays visible to
everyone.

**Access from the library's side**: each row lists who can open it. Worth knowing, because it is the one way
to lock someone out by accident — a member with no limits set can open every library, including ones added
later, so granting them one changes nothing and unticking them is what narrows them to an explicit list.

**File a series by hand** from its own page, or select several on the Library page and use **Move to
library**. A series filed by hand stays put across rescans, across creating a library whose path contains it,
and across re-pathing that library. Set it back to **Automatic** to hand it to the folder rule again.

**A library's path can be edited** instead of only its name, and the Library page grows a row of tabs once
you have more than one.

No files move, nothing is deleted, and no reading progress changes. An install with one library behaves
exactly as before.

### Age ratings, so a household can include children

Mark a series with a minimum age and cap what a member's account may open. Ratings come from ComicInfo's
`AgeRating` during a scan and can be set or corrected on any series page.

**Series with no rating stay visible.** Almost nothing in a real library carries one, so hiding unrated
content would empty an account the first time you set a limit. Setting a rating opts one title *in* to being
filtered; it never opts the rest of your library out. An install with no ratings and no limits behaves
exactly as before.

### MyAnimeList and Kitsu

Alongside AniList, and you can connect more than one at a time — each syncs independently, with its own
errors and its own progress, so one service being down cannot stop another.

### Nine languages, and right-to-left

English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese and Arabic, chosen under
**Profile → Language** and remembered across your devices. Arabic mirrors the whole layout, not just the text.

Everything except English is machine-assisted and says so, in that language. Each is one JSON file with
English strings as the keys, so a correction is a one-line pull request and a missing entry falls back to
English rather than showing a placeholder.

### Bookmark a page

A star in the reader marks where you are, with a per-series list. Bookmarks are kept when a series is
hidden, the same way reading progress is: a bookmark records having read something, not where the bytes are.

### OPDS links expire

They never did. One token per account, valid forever unless you happened to regenerate it — and it is the
one credential that lives in a reader app on a phone and gets forgotten. They now last a year, the profile
page shows when one was last used, and you can revoke it.

**Existing links are not cut off.** They get a year from now, not from when they were issued.

### PDF and image EPUB

Both are read now, and both are treated as what they are: an ordered run of page images in a container, the
same as a CBZ. A PDF's pages are rendered at reading resolution, so it behaves exactly like any other
chapter -- thumbnails, the reader, offline downloads and OPDS all work without knowing the difference.

EPUB pages come out in **spine order** rather than filename order, because manga bought from a store names
its image files by an internal id that sorts wrong.

**A text ebook is still not a chapter**, and that now falls out rather than being a rule: a reflowable novel
has no images in its spine, so it yields no pages and the scanner skips it. Dropping one into your library
does nothing instead of adding something that opens to a blank screen. Uchiyomi is a manga reader, not an
ebook library, and Kavita is the better answer if you want one.

### One container

`deploy/docker-compose.aio.yml` runs Uchiyomi as a single container: the API serves the web app itself
instead of a second nginx doing it. It is now the install the README leads with.
*(That file is simply `deploy/docker-compose.yml` since 2026-08-25 — see the Unreleased section.)*

Measured against the split layout on the same host: **238 MB instead of 385 MB**, **33 MiB of memory instead
of 41**, one less network hop on every API call, and no redirect at all on deep links -- nginx answered
`/library` with a 301 and this answers it with the page. nginx serves a static file about 0.9 ms faster,
which is the only thing it wins.

**Nothing breaks if you are already running the split layout.** It is still built, still published, still
documented, and `deploy/docker-compose.yml` is unchanged. The single-container build is additive: the same
API image serves the web app only when `WEB_ROOT` points at it.

> **Correction, 2026-08-25.** Two thirds of that paragraph still hold and one no longer does. The split
> layout is still built and still published, and nothing about a running install has stopped working. It is
> no longer *documented as an equal option*: the docs now lead with the single container, and the file moved

> layout the instructions actually describe. If you already downloaded the old file it keeps working — it
> pulls images by name, not by filename. See `docs/MIGRATING.md` when you want to move.

### Discover, rebuilt

The page that adds new series was a search box on black with a ragged grid hanging off it. Production
disagreed with that design: in 48 hours there were 32 requests for "what's new on this source" and **zero**
searches. So the wall of what your sources just published is the page now, led by a full-bleed hero built
from the AniList key art the endpoint had been returning since it shipped and the page was rendering as a
144px thumbnail. Forty-five sources across thirty languages collapse to one remembered language chip. Search
survives as a field, with a way back out that it never had.

**It is also much faster.** `GET /api/sources/latest` was the only endpoint of its kind with no time limit of
its own: it inherited the adapter's, which is 30 seconds for an extension source and 95 for a site behind
FlareSolverr. The worst measured call took **63 seconds**. It is now capped at 8 seconds (`SOURCE_LATEST_TIMEOUT_MS`),
cached for ten minutes per source and page, and concurrent requests for the same page collapse into one
outbound fetch instead of six. A source that times out is recorded against its health, so it earns a cooldown
and stops being asked first. The six sources fetched are now ranked by what your library actually came from,
rather than alphabetically, which had been putting sources with no series behind them ahead of the one that
supplied 80% of the collection.

The horizontal rails have **a visible scrollbar and arrows**. They had neither, and smooth scrolling eats a
vertical wheel over a horizontal strip, so on a desktop mouse there was no way to move them at all.

### Adult sources, and who may open Discover

Two account settings that existed only in name now hold:

**A member whose age limit is below 18 cannot reach a source its extension declares adult.** It is absent
from their source list, and the server refuses it by id. The app is a static export, so hiding it in the UI
would have left the JSON one guessed URL away. This is not an edge case on a real install: on the one this
was written against, 36 of 44 enabled sources are adult. Sources that declare nothing (the built-in engines, source
packs, custom sites) count as not adult, the same way an unrated series stays visible.

**A member who may not add series no longer sees Discover.** `canDownload` was enforced on exactly one route,
the final POST, so a denied account could browse every source, search them and read full series detail, and
only met a wall on the last button. Every route behind the page refuses now, and the tab is gone.

### An 18+ library stays off the shelf

Marking a library 18+ already capped who could open it. It now also decides what turns up unasked: such a
library is left out of the home rails, the library grid, search, browse-by-genre, collections, updates,
history, bookmarks and the OPDS feeds, and its tab is gone from the Library page. A **Show 18+** button beside
the sorts brings it back for as long as the browser is open, and hides it again by itself. The button appears
only for accounts that actually have such a library, and never for one whose own age limit is below 18.
Admins are not exempt, because this is about a tidy screen rather than about permission.

**It is not an access control**, and the distinction is the whole design. A link, a bookmark, an
offline-downloaded chapter, next-and-previous and reading progress all keep working while the library is
hidden. The alternative was tempting and wrong: the service worker flushes reading progress with the app
closed, an image tag carries no session, and an OPDS reader has no button to press, so folding this into the
access rule would have silently lost people's place in whatever they were reading.

Two long-standing gaps closed along the way. The library list had no notion of age limits at all, so a member
capped at 13 was shown the name of the 18+ shelf and a tab that could only ever be empty. And reading history
had no visibility rule whatsoever, so it kept listing the titles of series that had been deleted, merged away
or moved into a library that member no longer holds.

### Also

MangaDex asks its API for English and nothing else, but declared no language, so it joined all thirty
language groups: choosing Japanese filled a third of the wall with English MangaDex rows. It declares English
now. The language chips also count **sites** rather than rows, so one site installed once per language stops
presenting itself as thirty separate choices.

Editing a series' metadata failed with "Could not save" for **every** field, not just the age rating that
made it noticeable: the statement asked for seven values and was given six, so Postgres refused it. Queries
now fail loudly at the call site when their placeholders and parameters disagree, which is how this was
found and how the next one will be.

The comparison table gained the two rows where something else does more: **reflowable EPUB**, which Kavita
reads and this deliberately does not, and **Kobo device sync**, which Komga has and this has no answer for.
An unlisted gap is worse than a listed one.

## v0.8.1 — 2026-08-23

**Upgrade if you are on v0.8.0.** Its library page listed nothing.

### The library, search and browse pages were empty

v0.8.0 made the view context the first argument of every backend method, so that a call site which forgets
it fails to compile. One call site was cast to `any` and kept the old argument order, which is the one thing
that turns that guarantee off. The arguments shifted by one, the page offset landed past the end of the
library, and the result came back empty while the total count stayed correct.

Nothing was lost and nothing needs re-scanning: the rows were always there, the query simply asked for a
page beyond them. The library, search and browse pages and the command palette all read from that one
endpoint, so all four listed nothing.

### Offline downloads, which had never worked

Downloading a chapter to read offline asks the server for a manifest first, and that route talked to Komga's
HTTP API rather than to your own library. There is no Komga in a self-hosted install, so it answered "not
found" for every chapter, from the first release onwards. It now reads your library, and refuses a series
the viewer is not allowed to see.

### Two of the three OPDS feeds

`/opds` offers "recently updated", "A–Z" and "recently added". The first and third sorted by columns the
v0.8.0 rewrite stopped selecting, so both answered a server error for everyone, admins included, and the
broken one was listed first. Only A–Z worked.

### Deep links on any port other than 80

nginx listens on port 80 inside the container, and built its own redirects from that, so visiting
`http://localhost:8080/library` was redirected to `http://localhost/library/` with the port dropped. 8080 is
the documented default. Moving around the app never noticed, because that happens in the browser, but a
bookmark, a shared link or a reload on any path landed nowhere. Redirects are now relative.

### Renaming a folder had no button

v0.8.0 added the ability to rename a series' folder on disk, documented it, and shipped no way to reach it
outside of `curl`. There is now a **Rename folder** action on the series page for admins, which shows the
server's own refusal when a folder cannot be moved, since that message names the fix.

### Also

A malformed request body returned 500 with the whole validation error, schema field names included, rather
than 400. The handler meant to prevent that was registered after the routes it was meant to cover, so it had
never applied to any of them; internal error messages were reaching clients the same way.

## v0.8.0 — 2026-08-23

**Read this one before upgrading.** The library mount changed, and a security fix closed three ways to read a
series you were not meant to see.

### Three ways to read a hidden series, closed

All three predate this release, and all three needed nothing but an id.

`/img/lib/books/:id/page/:n` resolved a file path from a book id with no join to the series at all, so a book
id alone returned **raw page bytes off disk**, including for a series that had been deleted. The OPDS
download resolved the same way. The image server verified your token and then discarded who you were, so no
image route could filter by anything. And the chapter query never referenced the series table, so a chapter
inherited no series-level rule and next/previous walked the rest of it.

The visibility rule now lives in exactly one place instead of the twenty-three hand-written copies it had
spread into, and three tests hold that line: one fails if a twenty-fourth appears, one fails if a call site
invents an all-seeing viewer, and one requires every image and OPDS route to state how it is gated.

### Several libraries, and who can see them

Split your collection into separate libraries, then choose per member which ones they can open. Libraries are
**declared, not guessed**: the obvious rule, "each top-level folder is a library", would have renamed a lot of
existing installs into libraries named after their download sources.

Nothing changes on upgrade. Everything starts in one library, no reading progress moves, and an account with
no restriction set keeps seeing everything, including libraries created later.

### It can now rename folders and delete files, if you let it

Uchiyomi can rename a series' folder and delete its chapter files. **It cannot do either unless you run it as
the user who owns your library**, which is opt-in:

```
PUID=1000    # id -u
PGID=1000    # id -g
```

Leave both unset and nothing changes: the app runs as its own uid, your library is effectively read-only, and
the startup log says so plainly along with the exact command to change it.

`PUID=1000` is the common case and works: the app does not renumber its own user, so it will not collide with
the uid the base image already uses.

Deleting a series' files requires hiding the series first, so the reversible step always happens before the
irreversible one, and it keeps every chapter row and everyone's reading progress. Renaming refuses outright
unless every folder the series occupies is writable: renaming only half of a series that spans your library
and your downloads folder would split it in two on the next scan.

### Upgrading

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

**The library mount is no longer `:ro`.** That alone grants nothing, because the app still runs as a uid that
cannot write your files, but if you relied on the read-only flag as a guarantee, add it back:

```yaml
      - ${LIBRARY_PATH:-./library}:/library:ro
```

**The container now starts as root and immediately drops privileges** to its own uid (or `PUID`). Previously
it never ran as root at all. That is the cost of being able to run as the owner of your library; the
alternative was asking you to hand your media collection over to uid 10002. The app itself never runs as
root, and `PUID=0` is refused.

One thing worth being straight about: restricting someone's library access applies immediately on the server,
but images and chapters they already viewed or downloaded may stay in their own browser's offline storage
until they clear it. The server cannot reach into a device it does not control.

## v0.7.0 — 2026-08-22

**Library management.** The honest caveat in the README used to open by conceding that Komga and Kavita were
further along here. This release is that gap, measured and closed.

### Any folder layout

The scanner read exactly two directories below your library root, so a series had to be at
`<group>/<series>/<chapter>`. Anything else was invisible: no error, no log line, just an app that started
fine and showed nothing. A folder is now a series when it directly contains chapters, at any depth, so
`One Piece/Chapter 1.cbz`, `Manga/One Piece/…` and `Comics/Manga/Author/One Piece/…` are all read without
rearranging anything.

Existing libraries are untouched. This was verified against a copy of a real 210-series, 40,506-chapter
install: zero series rows and zero chapter rows changed. Set `LIBRARY_MAX_DEPTH=2` to reproduce the old
behaviour exactly; the default is 6.

### Metadata you edit stays edited

Only title and summary could be edited. Author, publication status and genres were read from ComicInfo and
silently rewritten by every scan, and scans happen constantly. All of them are now editable and survive a
rescan, and because genres drive Browse and the recommendation rails, editing one steers those too.

Chapters can be corrected as well. Numbers are parsed from filenames by taking the first number found, so
`Vol 2 Ch 5.cbz` was chapter 2: it sorted between 1 and 3, and 2 is what a tracker was told. Numbers and
titles now have a per-chapter override.

### Filters that actually filter

The library had one filter, genre, and every other filter silently returned the entire library rather than
erroring. Read state, publication status, author and multi-genre now work, filters live in the URL so the
back button works and a view can be shared, and a filter the query cannot express says so instead of quietly
widening. The "Most chapters" sort is now "Most unread" and sorts by your real unread count.

### Bulk actions

Select several series on the Library page and mark them read or unread, favourite them, or file them into a
collection. Marking a backlog read deliberately does not write reading events, so it cannot inflate streaks,
the household leaderboard or Wrapped.

### Your tracker can no longer be walked backwards

AniList accepts a lower progress and rewrites the entry, with no undo. Anything that reduced your highest
completed chapter would quietly send the smaller number: merging two series, marking a batch unread, or
correcting a chapter number. Progress is now monotonic per series, and lowering it takes a deliberate resync
from the series page. This closed a hazard that already existed before any of the above.

### Also

The admin Art tab was broken in v0.6.0 by a query with its `WHERE` below its `ORDER BY`; fixed in v0.6.1 and
now covered by a test. Next and previous chapter compared numbers alone, so two chapters sharing a number
made "next" arbitrary and could return the chapter you were already reading.

### Upgrading

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

The schema gains three tables and three columns on first boot, all additive. Nothing existing is rewritten,
and no scan re-mints anything.

## v0.6.1 — 2026-08-22

Two fixes for things a new install hits immediately.

**The admin Art tab was broken in v0.6.0.** The art overview query shipped with its `WHERE` written below
its `ORDER BY`, which Postgres rejects, so the endpoint returned a 500 and the whole Art Review gallery was
dead. It slipped out because the query lived inside a route handler and nothing in the test suite ever ran
it; it now lives in `lib/seriesArt` with a test that fails if the clause order is ever broken again.

**The documented library layout was wrong.** The README and USAGE told you to lay your library out as
`<series>/<chapter>`, but the scanner reads `<group>/<series>/<chapter>` — two levels below the library
root. Following the documentation gave you an app that started perfectly and showed an empty library, with
nothing to explain why. The docs now describe the layout the scanner actually reads, and the troubleshooting
section names this as the usual cause of an empty library.

So: `Manga/One Piece/Chapter 1.cbz` is found. `One Piece/Chapter 1.cbz` on its own is not. If your
collection is laid out the second way, wrapping it in a single folder is enough. A future release will read
any depth.

Nothing in this release changes the database.

## v0.6.0 — 2026-08-22

**Your library stops being a list of folders and starts being a list of series.** Until now a series was
whatever a folder was called, and its identity was derived from the path. Rename the folder, move it to
another disk, or let a source rename it for you, and Uchiyomi saw a brand new series: a second copy in the
library, an empty progress bar, and the one you had actually been reading stranded under a name that no
longer existed.

### Series management

- **Delete a series.** It hides rather than erases. Chapters, favourites, ratings, notes and above all your
  reading history stay attached to something real, so it is undoable and nothing silently rewrites your
  stats. A hidden series stays hidden across a rescan instead of reappearing under a new id.
- **Restore one**, exactly as it was.
- **Merge two into one**, for when the same series arrived twice from different sources. Everything the
  absorbed series held moves across, including every chapter and every progress row. Chapters that look
  like duplicates are deliberately **kept, not de-duplicated**: dropping one means folding two progress rows
  into one, and getting that wrong marks chapters unread and then syncs that outward to your AniList account,
  where it cannot be undone. Duplicate chapter numbers are untidy; lost reading progress is not recoverable.
- **Stop following a series**, or check one for new chapters on demand rather than waiting for the sweep.

### The library recognises files that moved

Chapters now carry a **content fingerprint** taken from the archive's index rather than its path, so a
renamed or relocated folder is matched back to the series it belongs to instead of being imported as a
stranger. Library ids are minted rather than derived from the path, which is what made the old behaviour
inevitable. Existing libraries are fingerprinted in the background, a slice at a time.

### Continue Reading offers the next chapter

Finishing a chapter used to remove the series from Continue Reading, and nothing put the next one in front
of you: you had to remember what you were reading and go find it, which is the one job that rail has. It now
shows the chapter you are part-way through, or the next one you have not read. A series you have finished
entirely still drops out. The rail also stopped being capped at 20, which was hiding most of a heavy
reader's list.

Also in the reader: **the manga name at the top is now a link to its series.** It was plain text, and the
back arrow beside it returns you to wherever you opened the chapter from, so from the home rail there was no
route to the series at all short of searching for it by name.

### Images stop waiting on things they already have

Covers were cached for five minutes, so most cover requests were round trips that returned a byte-identical
image. They are cached for a day now, which is safe because every way the art can change already busts the
url. Chapter thumbnails opened each archive twice, once to list it and once to read one page. Hero art warmed
one frame at a time. The disk cache walked every file every ten minutes to conclude it had nothing to do, and
its "least recently used" eviction sorted by *write* time, which a read never updates, so the first time it
filled it would have discarded the covers you look at daily and kept last night's page images.

### Your data now has referential integrity

Postgres enforces 14 foreign keys that were previously enforced by hope. Rows that already pointed at nothing
are copied into an `orphan_refs` table **before** being removed, so anything reclaimed is one `UPDATE` from
coming back rather than a restore from last night's dump.

`read_progress` deliberately does **not** cascade when a chapter is deleted. Nothing deletes chapters today,
but a cascade would have turned any future cleanup into silent, unrecoverable loss of reading history, so it
fails loudly instead and makes whoever writes that cleanup decide what should happen.

### Upgrading from v0.5.1

This release **migrates your database on first boot**, and the migration is one way. It adds columns and
foreign keys, and it moves rows that reference series or chapters which no longer exist into `orphan_refs`.
On the instance this was developed against that was 199 rows, none of them reading progress.

It is applied automatically and is safe to run, but it is the first release to change existing data rather
than only add to it, so taking a dump first is the cautious move:

```bash
docker compose exec -T uchiyomi-db pg_dump -U yomi yomi > uchiyomi-before-0.6.0.sql
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

That dump contains password hashes and API tokens. Delete it once the upgrade looks right.

As always, `docker compose up -d` alone does **not** fetch a newer image. Without the `pull` you stay on the
version you already have.

## v0.5.1 — 2026-08-21

**A fresh install could not write two of its own volumes.** If you installed from
`deploy/docker-compose.yml`, this one matters and the upgrade note below is not optional.

The runtime image created and gave ownership of `/cache` and `/backups` to the app user, but not `/config`
or `/library-dl`. Docker seeds a new named volume from the image directory it covers, so a directory the
image never creates arrives owned by root — and Uchiyomi runs as an unprivileged user. Three things failed
because of it, and none of them said why:

- **every chapter download failed**, so "it also fetches new chapters" did not work at all on a first install
- **adding a site by URL returned a bare error**, because that writes `/config/sites.json`
- **the generated JWT secret could not be saved**, so a new one was made on each boot — which signed
  *everybody* out on every restart

The setup script had always fixed this itself, but it only runs if you clone the repo, which is explicitly
not the documented way to install. All four directories are now created and owned correctly in the image.

### If you installed before this release

A new image cannot fix a volume you already have: Docker never re-seeds one that exists. Do this once.

```bash
docker compose down
docker volume ls | grep uchiyomi        # confirm the names — they are prefixed by your folder
docker run --rm -v uchiyomi_config:/a -v uchiyomi_downloads:/b alpine chown -R 10002:10002 /a /b
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

**On CasaOS**, the app directories are host bind mounts, which never inherit ownership from an image, so
this is a permanent requirement rather than a one-off:
`sudo chown -R 10002:10002 /DATA/AppData/uchiyomi`.

### Updating, in general

`docker compose up -d` on its own does **not** fetch a newer image — Docker reuses the `:latest` it already
has. Run `docker compose pull` first. This was never written down before, which means anyone who installed
earlier and tried to update has been sitting on their original version without knowing.

### Also

`JWT_SECRET` can now actually be set in `.env`; the install compose named it but never passed it through, so
setting it did nothing. `LIBRARY_BACKEND` had the same problem and is now a real setting rather than a
hardcoded value. And a pass over the documentation removed a set of claims that were simply untrue: an API
example that could never have worked, a 2FA recovery route that does not exist, a Node version the test suite
cannot run on, and a sources project that was never published. The route reference now matches the code
exactly — 142 documented, 142 real.

## v0.5.0 — 2026-08-20

The release that closes the gap with Mihon and Suwayomi, and one that finally shows the product.

**Mihon / Tachiyomi extensions.** Browse roughly 1,400 extensions from inside the admin panel and add one with
a click. They run on a bundled Suwayomi engine that starts with the stack and configures itself; installing an
extension switches its sources on straight away, so it is searchable from Discover immediately. Uchiyomi keeps
owning the library, reader, downloads and updates. It hosts nothing and ships no repository URL: you point it at
a repository you trust. The engine is a JVM and sits around 800 MB of RAM; set `SUWAYOMI_URL=` empty to turn the
whole feature off. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md).

**Single sign-on.** Optional OIDC against Authentik, Authelia, Keycloak or anything else that speaks OpenID
Connect, with optional group-to-admin mapping. Strictly additional: local accounts, 2FA, lockout and session
revocation are untouched, so a provider outage cannot lock you out of your own server.

**AniList sync.** Connect your account once and finishing a chapter updates your list on its own. Progress is
the highest chapter you have *finished*, so re-reading an old one never rewinds your list, and AniList being
slow or down can never delay a page turn.

**Library health.** A new admin tab that audits the library: chapter gaps, chapters that downloaded as one or
two images, duplicate series, impossible chapter numbers, and failing sources. Each check reports what it cannot
see as well as what it found.

**Scoped API tokens.** Long-lived, revocable tokens with read / write / admin scopes, listed beside your active
sessions. An admin's token still needs the admin scope before it can touch the admin API. There is an API
reference now too, at [docs/api.md](docs/api.md).

**Also**

- Reader settings follow your account instead of the device you set them on.
- A pull-based install (`deploy/docker-compose.yml`) and a CasaOS app manifest.
- Screenshots are now generated by a committed rig (`scripts/shots/`), so they stop rotting.
- Fixed: pages served from URLs without a file extension were stored with the wrong one, which made a chapter
  download perfectly, contain every image, and read as **zero pages**. Nothing errored.
- Fixed: `migrate()` now takes an advisory lock, so two processes starting at once cannot collide.

**Nothing to migrate.** New tables and columns are created on boot. With `SUWAYOMI_URL` unset, nothing about an
existing install changes.

## v0.4.0 — 2026-08-19

**Koryomi is now Uchiyomi.**

The old name didn't work in Japanese: romanized, "Koryomi" reads as こ-りょ-み (ko-**ryo**-mi), because `ryo`
is a single mora りょ — so the よみ of 読み ("reading") never survived. That broke the link to Tachiyomi
(立ち読み) and Suwayomi that the name was meant to signal, and left the 読 mark claiming something the name
didn't say.

**Uchiyomi** (うちよみ, 内読み) keeps よみ intact and follows the convention the ecosystem already uses:
Tachiyomi is standing-reading, Suwayomi is sitting-reading, **Uchiyomi is reading at home** — which is what a
self-hosted reader is. The logo evolves to match: the same faceted 読, now sheltered under a roof.

### Nothing to migrate
Only the product name changed. `yomi` is the shared root of both names, so every stateful identifier is
untouched — the database and its volumes, the offline IndexedDB, auth cookies, saved reader preferences, OPDS
entry ids, and container names. **Existing installs upgrade in place: nobody is logged out, no reading
progress resets, no downloaded chapter is orphaned.**

### If you pull images
Images now publish to **`ghcr.io/angelosha/uchiyomi-bff`** and **`ghcr.io/angelosha/uchiyomi-web`**. GHCR does
not redirect renamed packages, so the old `koryomi-*` images stay published and keep working — update your
compose file when convenient. ~~The GitHub repo moved to `AngeloSha/uchiyomi`; the old URL redirects.~~ The
repo move is still true; the promise about the images is not.

> **Correction (2026-08-21): the `koryomi-*` packages have been deleted, and `docker pull` of them now fails.**
> Keeping them published turned out to be worse than removing them: releases only ever publish `uchiyomi-*`,
> so `koryomi-*:latest` sat frozen at v0.3.0 while still reading as "latest" to anyone running it. Point your
> compose file at `ghcr.io/angelosha/uchiyomi-bff` and `ghcr.io/angelosha/uchiyomi-web`.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-08-19

Groundwork release: don't lose your data, don't ship broken reading, and don't retype your library.

### Backups
- Nightly backup of the database and your config, rotated automatically (14 runs by default) and restorable
  with plain `psql` — no matching tool versions needed. Runs at a configurable hour, shows up in
  **Admin → Tasks** with its last run and size, and has a **Run now** button.
- Point `BACKUP_PATH` at a host directory — ideally on a different physical disk, so a dead drive doesn't
  take the backups with it. Downloaded chapters and the image cache are deliberately excluded: both are
  large and reproducible.
- Restore instructions in [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md#11-backups--restore).

### Import
- Bring a library over from **Mihon / Tachiyomi** (`.tachibk` backup) or a **public MangaDex list**. Titles
  are parsed and shown for review first, with anything already in your library filtered out, before any
  importing starts. Pasting a plain list still works.
- Private MangaDex follows are not supported: they need an account login, which Uchiyomi doesn't ask for.

### Fixes
- **Downloads are now paced.** Every add previously spawned its own uncapped background download loop, so a
  large import meant hundreds of simultaneous downloads against a handful of sites — a good way to get your
  server blocked. All downloads now share a per-source concurrency limit and a politeness gap.
- Chapter dates: `"Chapter 12"` was being accepted as a date (December 2001) and could be stamped as a
  release date. Date parsing now requires text that actually looks like a date.

### Under the hood
- A test suite (30 tests) covering the logic that has actually broken before: the phantom-chapter guard,
  date parsing, volume vs chapter labelling, chapter ordering, hero art fitting, backup parsing, download
  pacing, and the reading-progress rules (run against a real Postgres, since they live in SQL). CI runs it
  on every pull request — previously a green build only proved the code compiled.
- Lockfiles added, so builds are reproducible.

## v0.2.1 — 2026-08-19

- Volume-based libraries read correctly: archives named as tomes (`Tome 01.cbr`, `Berserk T41`, `v01`) now
  label as **Vol. N** instead of Ch. N, and a mostly-volume series reports "N volumes". Chapter markers still
  win, so a release-version suffix like `Ch. 5 v2` stays a chapter.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-08-09

The "cinematic + convenient" release.

### Art & visuals
- Real banner art for the home hero: sharp, aspect-aware variants per device (`wide`/`tall` frames) —
  art close to the frame's shape is smart-cropped full-bleed; mismatched shapes render whole over an
  ambient blur of themselves. Pre-warmed server-side and preloaded client-side, so the hero loads instantly.
- Banner/cover backfill across the whole library from **AniList** (including banners from a manga's anime
  adaptation), **Kitsu** wide covers, and **MangaDex** high-res covers — plus an admin **Art Review** picker
  with per-series candidates.
- Hi-res cover pipeline (`?w=` variants) for detail posters and hero thumbs.

### Reader
- **Up Next**: finishing a series shows a card with related-series suggestions (both reading modes).
- **Double-page spreads** in paged mode — chapter covers solo, pairs after, RTL-aware for manga.
- **Page-preview scrubber**: dragging the progress slider shows a live thumbnail of the target page.
- Chapter dividers labeled "Up Next · {chapter}".

### Home & series
- Cinematic series page: title-over-art hero with author, status, chapter count, "Updated X ago", and
  rating badges; "More like this" rail; "Because you read {title}" rails on Home.
- Chapter release dates surfaced throughout (Updates feed sorts by them).

### Convenience
- **Ctrl+K command palette**: instant series search, quick actions, recents; live results in the top bar.
- **Collections**: create/reorder reading lists with accent colors; add from any series page; Home rail.
- **Reading history** timeline page.
- **Mark as read** (chapter / previous / whole series) and **bulk offline-download delete** (per series or all).

### Accuracy & robustness
- Chapter completions now record reliably (fast-scrolling past a last page used to miss them — this starved
  streaks and the leaderboard). Completion is retroactive on chapter-crossing, immediate on the last page,
  and server-enforced as a safety net. Re-reading a chapter no longer un-reads it.
- Offline reading progress syncs in the background; push subscriptions self-heal after browser rotation;
  the updater's first run respects the configured interval.

### Sources
- Madara engine: falls back to the manga page when a site's ajax chapter endpoint serves junk (fixes
  ManhuaPlus updates), on top of the earlier cross-title widget scoping fix.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-07-02

Initial public release.
